in whole or in part, by the board.
                                             
 III. The board may take disciplinary action in any one or more of

applying for licensure, the board may issue an order directing the
licensee or applicant to appear and show cause why similar disciplinary
action or, in the case of an applicant, license denial or restriction,
should not be imposed in this state. In any such proceeding, the
decision of the foreign licensing authority may not be collaterally
attacked, but the licensee or applicant shall be given the opportunity
to demonstrate why a lesser sanction should be imposed. When acting
under this paragraph, the board may issue any disciplinary sanction or
take any action with regard to a license application, which would
otherwise be permitted by this chapter, including sanctions or actions
more stringent than those imposed by the foreign jurisdiction. The board
shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, relative to handling summary
proceedings brought under this paragraph, but shall furnish the
respondent at least 10 days' written notice and an opportunity to be
heard.

professional liability insurance to a licensee of the board shall send a
complete report to the board as to all reservable claims and suits
coincident with the initiation of an action for dental injury within 30
days after the initiation of the action. For the purpose of this
paragraph, dental injury means any adverse, untoward, or undesired
consequences arising out of or sustained in the course of professional
services rendered by a dental care provider, whether resulting from
negligence, error, or omission in the performance of such services; from
rendition of such services without informed consent or in breach of
warranty or in violation of contract; from failure to diagnose; from
premature abandonment of a patient or of a course of treatment; from
failure properly to maintain equipment or appliances necessary to the
rendition of such services; or otherwise arising out of or sustained in
the course of such services.
                                             
 (b) The board shall conduct an investigation of any person
licensed by the board who has been the subject of 3 insurance claims or
legal judgments for medical injury as defined in RSA 329:17, III, which
pertain to 3 different events within any consecutive 5-year period
commencing with January 1, 1988.

 I. The board may investigate possible misconduct by licensees and
any other matters governed by the provisions of this chapter.
Investigations may be conducted with or without the issuance of a board
order setting forth the general scope of the investigation, and with or
without prior notification to the licensee. An investigation may include
unannounced inspections of the licensee's practice location when deemed
necessary to determine day-to-day practices or to prevent evidence from
being hidden, altered, or destroyed. Board investigations and any
information obtained by the board pursuant to such investigations shall
be exempt from the public disclosure provisions of RSA 91-A, unless such
information subsequently becomes the subject of a public disciplinary
hearing. However, the board may disclose information obtained in an
investigation to law enforcement or health licensing agencies in this
state or any other jurisdiction, or in accordance with specific
statutory requirements or court orders.
                                             
 II. The board may retain legal counsel, dental advisors or other
investigators through the office of professional licensure and
certification to assist with any investigation and with adjudicatory
hearings.
                                             
 III. The board may commence a formal or informal investigation, or
an adjudicative hearing, concerning allegations of misconduct and other
matters within the scope of this chapter on its own motion whenever it
has a reasonable basis for doing so, and the type of procedure chosen
shall be a matter reserved to the discretion of the board.
Investigations may be conducted on an ex parte basis.
                                             
 IV. (a) The board may administer oaths or affirmations, preserve
testimony, and issue subpoenas for witnesses and for documents during
any formal investigation or adjudicatory hearing. The board may also
subpoena patient records, as provided in paragraph V, during formal
investigations.
                                             
 (b) The board shall serve any subpoena not covered by paragraph V
in accordance with the procedures and fee schedules established by the
superior court, except that:
                                             
 (1) Any person licensed by the board shall not be entitled to
a witness fee or mileage expenses for travel within the state.
                                             
 (2) The board shall not be required to tender witness fees and
mileage expenses in advance if the subpoena is annotated "fees
guaranteed by the New Hampshire board of dental examiners.''
                                             
 (3) The respondent shall be allowed at least 48 hours to
comply with a subpoena issued under this chapter.
                                             
 V. The board may at any time subpoena dental records from its
licensees and patient records from hospitals, pharmacies, and other
health care providers or facilities licensed by or certified in this
state. Such subpoenas shall be served by certified mail or by personal
delivery to the address shown on the licensee's current license, and no
witness or other fee shall be required. A minimum of 15 days' advance
notice shall be allowed for complying with a subpoena duces tecum issued
under this chapter.
                                             
 VI. All licensees and any persons applying for licensure or any
other privilege granted by the board shall have the duty to keep the
board informed of their current business and residence addresses. Notice
of any hearing or other action taken under this chapter shall be deemed
adequate if notice is mailed to the most recent home or business address
furnished to the board by the licensee, pursuant to RSA 317-A:13, III.
                                             
 VII. Any complaint of licensee misconduct shall be in writing and
shall be treated as a petition for the commencement of an adjudicatory
hearing. The board shall fairly investigate all complaints to the extent
and in the manner warranted by the allegations. Any complaint which
fails to state a cause of action may be summarily denied in whole or in
part. Some or all of the allegations in a complaint may be consolidated
with another complaint or with issues which the board wishes to
investigate or hear on its own motion. If an investigation of a
complaint results in an offer of settlement by the licensee, the board
may settle the allegations against the licensee without the consent of a
complainant, provided that material facts are not in dispute and the
complainant is given an opportunity to comment upon the terms of the
proposed settlement.
                                             
 VIII. At the commencement of an adjudicatory proceeding, or at any
time during a formal or informal investigation, and without issuing a
subpoena, the board may mail a statement of the issues being
investigated or heard to any licensee or other person who is a proper
subject of inquiry and require the licensee or other person to provide a
detailed and good faith written response to the allegations identified
by the board. The licensee or other person shall provide complete copies
of office records concerning any patient whose treatment is relevant to
the matters at issue. The licensee shall respond to such request within
a reasonable time period of not less than 15 days, as the board may
specify in its written request.

affirmations to witnesses.
                                             
 II. The board shall furnish the licensee or any other respondent at
least 15 days' written notice of the date, time and place of a hearing,
except as otherwise provided in this chapter. Such notice shall include
an itemization of the issues to be heard, and, in the case of a
disciplinary hearing, a statement as to whether the action has been
initiated by a written complaint or upon the board's own motion, or
both. If a written complaint is involved, the complainant shall also
receive a copy of the hearing notice and shall be provided with a
reasonable opportunity to intervene as a party.
                                             
 III. Any person appearing at a board hearing or investigation may be
represented by legal counsel, but the board shall have no obligation or
authority to appoint or provide an attorney to any person appearing at a
board hearing or investigation.
                                             
 IV. The board may at any time dispose of issues or allegations at an
adjudicatory hearing, or an investigation, by default, settlement
agreement, or consent order, by issuing an order of dismissal for
failing to state a proper basis for disciplinary action. In adjudicatory
or disciplinary hearings, the board may hold prehearing conferences
which shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 91-A, but all final
disciplinary actions, including those which occur without holding a
public hearing, shall be available to the public.

served upon the parties.
                                             
 VI. Decisions of the board may be appealed to the supreme court
pursuant to RSA 541. The court shall not stay any disciplinary sanction
imposed by the board pending appeal, if the board has determined that
the sanction is required for the public safety and welfare.

cases involving imminent danger to life or health, the board shall order
suspension of a license or privilege granted under this chapter pending
hearing for a period of no more than 60 days. In such cases, the basis
for the board's finding of imminent danger to life or health shall be
reduced to writing and combined with a hearing notice which complies
with RSA 541-A:31, III. Notwithstanding the requirements of RSA
541-A:30, III, the board's hearing may commence as much as 30 days after
the date of the order suspending the license. If the board does not
commence the hearing within 30 days, the suspension order shall be
automatically vacated, but a licensee shall be allowed additional time
to prepare for or to complete a hearing under this paragraph only by
agreeing to a further suspension commensurate with the additional time
extended.
