INTERSTATE LIBRARY COMPACT
--------------------------

### Section 201-B:1

 **201-B:1 Compact Enacted. –** The Interstate Library Compact is
hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with all states
legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:

**Article I**

**Policy and Purpose**


                                             
 Because the desire for the services provided by libraries transcends
governmental boundaries and can most effectively be satisfied by giving
such services to communities and people regardless of jurisdictional
lines, it is the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate
and share their responsibilities; to authorize cooperation and sharing
with respect to those types of library facilities and services which can
be more economically or efficiently developed and maintained on a
cooperative basis, and to authorize cooperation and sharing among
localities, states and others in providing joint or cooperative library
services in areas where the distribution of population or of existing
and potential library resources make the provision of library service on
an interstate basis the most effective way of providing adequate and
efficient service.

**Article II**

**Definitions**


                                             
 As used in this compact:
                                             
 (a) "Public library agency'' means any unit or agency of local or
state government operating or having power to operate a library.
                                             
 (b) "Private library agency'' means any non-governmental entity
which operates or assumes a legal obligation to operate a library.
                                             
 (c) "Library agreement'' means a contract establishing an
interstate library district pursuant to this compact or providing for
the joint or cooperative furnishing of library services.

**Article III**

district. Subject to the provisions of this compact and any other laws
of the party states which pursuant hereto remain applicable, such
district may establish, maintain and operate some or all of the library
facilities and services for the area concerned in accordance with the
terms of a library agreement therefor. Any private library agency or
agencies within an interstate library district may cooperate therewith,
assume duties, responsibilities and obligations thereto, and receive
benefits therefrom as provided in any library agreement to which such

agencies for the extension of library privileges to the use of
facilities or services operated or rendered by one or more of the
individual library agencies.
                                             
 (c) If a library agreement provides for joint establishment,
maintenance or operation of library facilities or services by an
interstate library district, such district shall have power to do any
one or more of the following in accordance with such library agreement:
                                             
 1. Undertake, administer and participate in programs or
arrangements for securing, lending or servicing of books and other
publications, any other materials suitable to be kept or made available
by libraries, library equipment or for the dissemination of information
about libraries, the value and significance of particular items therein,

 5. Sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                                             
 6. Acquire, hold, and dispose of any real or personal property or
any interest or interests therein as may be appropriate to the rendering
of library service.
                                             
 7. Construct, maintain and operate a library, including any
appropriate branches thereof.

operates any facilities or services in its own right shall have a

states may undertake and conduct joint or cooperative library programs,
render joint or cooperative library services, and enter into and perform
arrangements for the cooperative or joint acquisition, use, housing and
disposition of items or collections of materials which, by reason of
expense, rarity, specialized nature, or infrequency of demand therefor
would be appropriate for central collection and shared use. Any such
programs, services or arrangements may include provision for the
exercise on a cooperative or joint basis of any power exercisable by an
interstate library district and an agreement embodying any such program,
service or arrangement shall contain provisions covering the subjects
detailed in Article VI of this compact for interstate library

prior to and as a condition precedent to its entry into force, be
submitted to the attorney general of each state in which a public
library agency party thereto is situated, who shall determine whether

state. The attorneys general shall approve any agreement submitted to
them unless they shall find that it does not meet the conditions set
forth herein and shall detail in writing addressed to the governing
bodies of the public library agencies concerned the specific respects in
which the proposed agreement fails to meet the requirements of law.
Failure to disapprove an agreement submitted hereunder within 90 days of
its submission shall constitute approval thereof.
                                             
 (b) In the event that a library agreement made pursuant to this

submitted to the state officer or agency having such power of control
and shall be approved or disapproved by him or it as to all matters
within his or its jurisdiction in the same manner and subject to the
same requirements governing the action of the attorneys general pursuant
to paragraph (a) of this article. This requirement of submission and
approval shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the
requirement of submission to and approval by the attorneys general.

**Article VIII**

public library agency is situated, may pledge its credit in support of
an interstate library district established by the agreement.

agency thereof is party shall be filed. The administrator shall have
such other powers as may be conferred upon him by the laws of his state
and may consult and cooperate with the compact administrators of other
party states and take such steps as may effectuate the purposes of this
compact. If the laws of a party state so provide, such state may
designate one or more deputy compact administrators in addition to its
compact administrator.

 (b) This compact shall continue in force with respect to a party
state and remain binding upon such state until 6 months after such state

that agreement prior to the end of its duration as provided therein.

**Article XII**

**Construction and Severability**

purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and
if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared
to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United
States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this
compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person
or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be
held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the
