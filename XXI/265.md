### Section 265:10

 **265:10 Traffic Control Signal Legend. –** Whenever traffic is
controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored
lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively, one at a time or in
combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights
shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as
follows:
                                             
 I. Green Indication.
                                             
 (a) Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place
prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles
turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent
crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.
                                             
 (b) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or
in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such
other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians
lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully
using the intersection.
                                             
 (c) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, as
provided in RSA 265:11, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when
the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
                                             
 II. Steady Yellow Indication.
                                             
 (a) Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow
arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being
terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
                                             
 (b) Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as
provided in RSA 265:11, are thereby advised that there is insufficient
time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no
pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
                                             
 III. Steady Red Indication.
                                             
 (a) Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone
shall stop at a clearly marked stop line or before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication
to proceed is shown except as provided in subparagraphs III, (b) and
(f).
                                             
 (b) When a sign is in place permitting a turn, traffic, except
pedestrians, facing a steady circular red signal may cautiously enter
the intersection to make the turn indicated by the sign after stopping,
as required in subparagraph III(a). Such vehicular traffic shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk

 I. Whenever the commissioner of transportation shall determine, upon
the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation, or in the event
of vehicle or weather emergencies, that any prima facie speed limit
hereinbefore set forth is greater or less than is reasonable or safe
under the conditions found to exist at any intersection or other place
or upon any part of the state highway system, outside the compact part
of cities or towns, said commissioner may determine and declare a
reasonable and safe prima facie speed limit thereat which shall be
effective when appropriate signs giving notice thereof are erected. Such
signs may carry either a fixed speed limit legend or a changeable
message so designed as to permit display of different speed limits at
various times of the day or night. Such a prima facie speed limit may be
declared to be effective at all times or at such times as are indicated
upon the said signs. The said commissioner shall keep and maintain a
full and complete record of all speed zones established by him and all
alterations, amendments or removal thereof.
                                             
 II. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I and RSA 265:60,
II, or any other law to the contrary, upon recommendation of the
commissioner of transportation and a determination by the governor and
council that it is in the public interest to conserve motor vehicle
fuels or to conform with other national goals, the governor and council
may establish temporary prima facie speed limits upon any part,
including, but not limited to, the ways specified in RSA 265:60, II(e),
of the state highway system outside the compact part of cities and
towns. Such temporary speed limits shall become effective when
appropriate signs giving notice of the limits thereby established are
erected.
                                             
 III. The commissioner of transportation shall keep and maintain a
full and complete record of all temporary speed zones established
pursuant to paragraph II and all alterations, amendments or removal
thereof. Such temporary speed limits shall remain in effect until
rescinded by the governor and council, or 12 months from the effective
date of establishment, whichever occurs first. Said temporary speed
limit may be reimposed, with or without lapse, as hereinbefore
provided.
                                             
 IV. (a) The commissioner of transportation, upon the petition of the
governing body of a municipality, shall determine if any prima facie
speed limit hereinbefore set forth should be reduced to provide
reasonable and safe conditions upon any part of the state highway system
within the compact part of cities or towns; provided, however, the
resulting speed limit shall not be less than 25 miles per hour.
                                             
 (b) The petition shall designate the area of the state highway
system and the reasons for the reduction in the speed limit. The review
of the petition shall include an engineering and traffic investigation
and consultation with the petitioners. The commissioner shall provide
the petitioners, in writing, the results of his findings. The
commissioner may recommend a decrease in the posted prima facie speed
limit, but in no case shall the resulting speed limit be below 25 miles
per hour.
                                             
 V. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I and RSA 265:60,
II, or any other law to the contrary, the commissioner of
transportation, upon the petition of the governing body of a
municipality, shall determine if any prima facie speed should be reduced
to provide reasonable and safe conditions upon any part of the state
highway system that is seasonally congested by pedestrian and bicycle
traffic, as determined by the governing body of the municipality.
                                             
 (b) The petition shall designate the area of the state highway
system and the reasons for the reduction in the speed limit. The review
of the petition shall include consultation with the petitioners. The
commissioner shall provide the petitioners, in writing, the results of
his findings. The commissioner may recommend a seasonal decrease in the
posted prima facie speed limit, but in no case shall the resulting speed
limit be below 20 miles per hour.
                                             
 (c) There shall be only one seasonal speed limit, of a maximum
duration of 4 months, in any 12-month period.

### Section 265:79-c

 **265:79-c Use of Mobile Electronic Devices While Driving;
Prohibition. –**
                                             
 I. (a) No person, while driving a moving motor vehicle upon a way or
temporarily halted in traffic for a traffic control device or other
momentary delay, shall use any hand-held mobile electronic device
capable of providing voice or data communication, including but not
limited to: reading, composing, viewing, or posting any electronic
message; or initiating, receiving, or conducting a conversation; or
initiating a command or request to access the Internet; or inputting
information into a global positioning system or navigation device; or
manually typing data into any other portable electronic device. An
operator of a motor vehicle who holds a cellular telephone or other
electronic device capable of voice communication in the immediate
proximity of his or her ear while such vehicle is in motion is presumed
to be engaging in a call within the meaning of this section.
                                             
 (b) "Driving,'' for the purposes of this section, shall not
include when a person is behind the controls of a vehicle that has
pulled to the side of or off the road at a location where it is legal to
do so and where the vehicle remains stationary.
                                             
 II. It shall not be an offense under this section for any person
driving a motor vehicle upon a way:
                                             
 (a) To make use of a cellular telephone or other electronic
device capable of voice communication to report an emergency to the
enhanced 911 system or directly to a law enforcement agency, fire
department, or emergency medical provider.
                                             
 (b) To use one hand to transmit or receive messages on any
non-cellular 2-way radio.
                                             
 (c) To use a Bluetooth enabled or other hands-free electronic
device, or a similar device that is physically or electronically
integrated into a motor vehicle, for such a purpose to send or receive
information provided the driver does not have to divert his or her
attention from the road ahead. As used in this section, "hands-free
electronic device'' means a mobile electronic device that has an
internal feature or function, or that is equipped with an attachment or
addition, whether or not permanently part of such mobile electronic
device, by which a user engages in conversation without the use of
either hand; provided, however, this definition shall not preclude the
use of either hand merely to activate, deactivate, or initiate a
function of the telephone.
                                             
 (d) To perform any action required by an ignition interlock
device.
                                             
 III. Any person who violates this section shall be guilty of a
violation and shall be fined 
                                             $100 plus penalty assessment for a first
offense, 
                                             $250 plus penalty assessment for a second offense, and 
                                             $500
plus penalty assessment for any subsequent offense within a 24-month
period.
                                             
 IV. No person less than 18 years of age shall use a cellular or
mobile telephone or other mobile electronic device, whether hands-free
or not, while driving a motor vehicle in motion or temporarily stopped
in traffic upon any way, except to report an emergency to the enhanced
911 system or any public safety agency. A person violating this
paragraph shall be subject to the fines in paragraph III and license
suspension or revocation under RSA 263:14, III.
                                             
 V. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a driver, regardless of
age, from receiving aural routing information from a hands-free global
positioning device or navigation service through a mobile electronic
device; or receiving turn-by-turn routing information from the screen of
a global positioning device or navigation service through a mobile
electronic device that is integrated into the vehicle or mounted on the
dashboard, windshield, or visor of the vehicle.

 I. (a) Any person whose license is suspended or revoked under this
subdivision or RSA 263:96 may request either an administrative review or
a hearing. The request shall be in writing and shall state the grounds
upon which the person seeks to have the order of suspension or
revocation rescinded, which grounds shall be limited to those provided
in paragraph II. The filing of the request shall not stay the suspension
or revocation. A request for either administrative review or hearing
received by the department after 30 days from the date the notice is
issued shall be denied as untimely.
                                             
 (b) If the request is for an administrative review, the request
may be accompanied by any statement or other evidence which the person
wants the department to consider. Upon receiving the request the
department shall review the order, the evidence upon which it is based,
including whether the person was driving or in actual physical control
of a motor vehicle, and any other information brought to the attention
of the department, and shall determine whether sufficient cause exists
to sustain the order.
                                             
 (c) If the request is for a hearing, the request shall also
indicate whether or not the person desires to have the law enforcement
officer present. The hearing shall be held within 20 days after the
filing of the request unless the person requests a continuance. A
request for a continuance by the person shall not stay the order of
suspension or revocation. The hearing shall be recorded, and be
conducted by the department's designated agent. The hearing may be
conducted upon a review of the law enforcement officer's report if there
is no request to have the officer present. If there is a request that
the law enforcement officer be present at the hearing and the officer
fails to appear without good cause shown, the case shall be dismissed
and the order rescinded. If the person requesting the hearing fails to
appear without good cause shown, the right to a hearing shall be waived
and the order sustained.
                                             
 II. The scope of the administrative review or hearing shall be
limited to the issue of whether the person had been arrested.
                                             
 III. In the case of either an administrative review or a hearing,
the hearing examiner shall issue his or her recommendation on the order
of suspension or revocation within 15 days of the request for
administrative review or the hearing date. The recommendation shall be
in writing and a copy shall be provided to the parties. The
recommendation shall be final unless a review or appeal is filed under
RSA 265:91-d or RSA 265:91-e.

ruling. The filing of the petition shall not stay a suspension or
revocation of the person's driver's license or privilege to drive if

privilege to drive. The review shall determine whether the ruling is
erroneous as a matter of law or cannot be sustained by the facts as
