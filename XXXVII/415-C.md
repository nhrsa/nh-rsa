 I. No obligor, its designee, or any other representative of an

any benefits, advantages, conditions, terms, or services available under
a consumer guaranty contract:

 (c) Require the purchase of a consumer guaranty contract or
represent that the purchase is mandatory.

of this chapter. However, a company using the prohibited language in its
name shall conspicuously disclose in its consumer guaranty contracts a
statement substantially as follows: "This agreement is not an insurance
contract.''
                                             
 (f) Fail to act promptly upon communications with respect to

 II. An obligor shall not make, permit, or cause any practice that:
                                             
 (a) Fails to perform the services promised under the contract in

 (c) The consumer does not have the right to bring an action to
enforce the terms of the contract or otherwise challenge the denial of a
claim which the consumer believes is wrongful. Consumer guaranty
contracts may include provisions requiring the parties to submit to
alternative dispute resolution, including a provision requiring binding
arbitration that would expressly limit the right of the consumer to
bring an action in a court of law, if such provision complies with and
does not impede the rights of the consumer as provided under RSA 542.
All arbitration provisions shall state that they are subject to RSA 542;
or
                                             
 (d) Any civil action or alternative dispute resolution procedure
brought in connection with the consumer guaranty contract shall be
brought in the courts of a jurisdiction other than New Hampshire.
                                             
 IV. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair or in any
way affect any rule or law applicable to or governing consumer guaranty
contracts.

 I. Consumer guaranty contracts insured under a reimbursement
insurance policy shall state:
                                             
 (a) The name, address, and toll-free number of the reimbursement

 (b) The obligation of the reimbursement insurer to reimburse or,
in the event of the obligor's non-performance, to pay on behalf of the
obligor any sums the obligor is legally obligated to pay or shall
provide the service which the obligor is legally obligated to undertake
according to the obligor's contractual obligations under the consumer
guaranty contracts issued or sold by the obligor. In the event the
obligor does not provide for covered services within 60 days after the
contract holder has submitted proof of loss to the obligor, the contract
holder is entitled to apply directly to the reimbursement insurance
company for satisfaction.
                                             
 II. This chapter shall not prevent or limit the right of an insurer
which issued a reimbursement insurance policy to seek indemnification or
subrogation against an obligor if the issuer pays or is obligated to pay
the contract holder sums that the obligor was obligated to pay pursuant
to the provisions of the consumer guaranty contract or under a
contractual agreement.
                                             
 III. As applicable, an insurer that issued a reimbursement insurance
policy shall not terminate the policy until a notice of termination in
accordance with RSA 417-C has been mailed or delivered to the obligor.
The termination of a reimbursement insurance policy shall not reduce the
obligor's responsibility for consumer guaranty contracts issued by the
obligor prior to the date of the termination.

engaged in the business of consumer guaranty contracts in this state to
determine compliance or noncompliance with this chapter. The expenses of
examinations shall be paid to the state by the company or companies
examined.

 III. Impose a penalty of not more than 
                                             $1000 for each violation or

                                             $10,000 for each violation the commissioner finds to be willful.

of an Obligor. â€“**
                                             
 I. When an obligor, its designee, or any other representative of an
obligor, including a seller or administrator, in any action or
proceeding brought by the insurance commissioner has been found to be in
violation of this chapter or has been ordered to cease and desist, and
said finding or order has become final, any consumer claiming to be
adversely affected by the act or practice giving rise to such finding or
order, and to whom restitution has not been provided under RSA 415-C:10,
IV or to whom the obligor, its designee or representative has not made
voluntary restitution acceptable to the consumer within 30 days of the
finding or order, may bring suit against said obligor to recover such
damages or loss that have been suffered by him or her because of such
action or practice.
                                             
 II. For the sole purposes of providing the consumer with the
procedural rights set forth under RSA 541 and RSA 541-A, failure of the
commissioner to take action under RSA 415-C:10 within 120 days from the
date of the receipt of a complaint from an alleged injured person shall
constitute a finding that the alleged act or practice is not in
violation of this chapter. This finding may be appealed in accordance
with RSA 541. If upon appeal the decision of the commissioner is not
upheld, the consumer may proceed under RSA 415-C:10-a, I. This provision
shall not bar the commissioner from bringing an enforcement action for
violation of this chapter more than 120 days after receipt of a
complaint.

it is held invalid, shall not be affected.
