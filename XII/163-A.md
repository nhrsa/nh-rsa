NEW ENGLAND INTERSTATE PLANNING COMPACT
---------------------------------------

### Section 163-A:1

 **163-A:1 Compact Authorized. â€“** The New England Interstate
Planning Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with any
other state or states legally joining therein in the form substantially
as follows:

**NEW ENGLAND INTERSTATE PLANNING COMPACT**

**ARTICLE I**

**Findings**


                                             
 New England is by virtue of geographic location and other
characteristics a great population, cultural, economic, and resource
area which, with more intense use of physical, social, and economic
resources, increasingly requires coordinated planning as a basic
ingredient of effective and orderly growth of the region. To this end,
it is the intent of this compact to establish and provide for the
operation of an interstate planning agency for New England.

**ARTICLE II**

**Purpose**


                                             
 It is the purpose of this compact to provide, in the New England
region, improved facilities and procedures for the coordination of the
policies, programs, and activities of interstate significance in the New
England region in the field of physical, social, and economic resources,
and to study, investigate, and plan appropriate governmental activities
with respect to the conservation, development and use of the same; to
provide means by which interstate conflicts may be resolved; and to
provide procedures for interstate coordination of the interests of all
public and private agencies, persons and entities in the fields covered
by this compact, and to provide an organization for cooperation in such
coordination.

**ARTICLE III**

**Creation of Commission**


                                             
 There is hereby created the New England Interstate Planning
Commission, hereinafter called the commission.

**ARTICLE IV**

**Membership**


                                             
 The commission shall consist of one member from each party state to
be appointed and to serve, in accordance with and subject to the laws of
the State which he represents. Any member of the commission may be
represented by an alternate with power to act in his place and stead, if
the laws of his state so provide and if notice of the designation of
such alternate is given to the commission in such manner as its bylaws
may provide.

**ARTICLE V**

**Functions**


                                             
 To carry out the purpose of the compact it shall be the
responsibility of the commission to prepare studies and plans, and to
recommend procedures for implementing coordination of the policies and
programs and activities of interstate significance in the field of
physical, social, and economic conservation and development in the New
England region which may include the following:
                                             
 (1) Collection and interpretation of basic data.
                                             
 (2) Investigation, planning, and programming (including
scheduling) of projects of interstate or regional significance.
                                             
 (3) Planning and scheduling of governmental services and programs
which would be of assistance to the orderly growth and prosperity of the
region, and to the well-being of its population.
                                             
 (4) Encouraging of the referral of plans or proposals for
projects and programs of interstate or regional significance to the
commission.
                                             
 (5) Studying and recommending means for the most effective
utilization of such federal assistance as may be available on a regional
basis or as may have an interstate or regional impact.
                                             
 (6) Assisting the party states, or any of them, in cooperative
planning undertakings with the federal government or any agencies
thereof.
                                             
 To avoid duplication of effort and in the interests of economy, the
commission shall make use of existing studies, surveys, plans, data, and
other materials in the possession of the governmental agencies of the
party states and their respective subdivisions or in the possession of
other interstate agencies. Each such agency, within available
appropriations and if not expressly prevented or limited by law, is
hereby authorized to make such materials available to the commission and
to otherwise assist it in the performance of its functions. At the
request of the commission each such agency is further authorized to
provide the commission with information regarding plans and programs
affecting the New England region so that the commission may have
available to it current information with respect thereto.
                                             
 The commission shall use qualified public and private agencies to
make investigations and conduct research, but if it is unable to secure
the undertaking of such investigations or original research by a
qualified public or private agency, it shall have the power to make its
own investigations and conduct its own research. The commission may make
contracts with any public or private agencies or private persons or
entities for the undertaking of such investigations or original research
within its purview.
                                             
 The officers and personnel of agencies of the party states, and of
any other government or agency whatever, or private citizens, or
representatives of private organizations, may serve at the request of
the commission upon such advisory committees as the commission may
determine to create; and such officers and personnel of any such
government or agency may serve upon such committees without forfeiture
of office or employment and with no loss or diminution in the status,
rights and privileges which they otherwise enjoy.

**ARTICLE VI**

**Cooperation With the Federal Government and Other Governmental
Entities**


                                             
 Each party state is hereby authorized to participate in cooperative
or joint planning undertakings with the federal government, any
appropriate agency or agencies thereof, or with any interstate agency or
agencies. Such participation shall be at the instance of the governor or
in such other manner as state laws may provide or authorize. The
commission shall facilitate the work of state representatives in any
joint interstate or cooperative federal-state undertaking authorized by
this Article, and each such state shall keep the commission advised of
its activities in respect of such undertakings, to the extent that they
have interstate or regional significance.

**ARTICLE VII**

action of the commission shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at
which a majority of the commission members are present and a majority of
the total number of votes on the commission are cast in favor thereof;
provided that any action not binding by reason of failure to meet this
requirement may be ratified within 30 days by the concurrence in writing
of a majority of the commission members.
