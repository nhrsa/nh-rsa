 II. The limited liability company shall commence the proceeding in
superior court of the county where the limited liability company's

company interests, and all parties must be served with a copy of the
petition. Nonresidents may be served by registered or certified mail or

dissenter's after-acquired membership rights for which the limited
liability company elected to withhold payment under RSA 304-C:168.
                                             
 VII. The limited liability company shall be entitled to judgment

 I. The court in an appraisal proceeding commenced under RSA

reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the
court. The court shall assess the costs against the limited liability

substantially comply with the requirements of RSA 304-C:161 through RSA
304-C:169.
                                             
 (b) Against either the limited liability company or a dissenter,
in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against
whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously,
or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this
subdivision.
                                             
 III. If the court finds that the services of counsel for any
dissenter were of substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly
situated and that the fees for those services should not be assessed
against the limited liability company, the court may award to these
counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amount awarded to the
dissenters who were benefited.

 II. When a transfer of all or a portion of a member's limited
liability company interest is in effect and a copy is delivered to the
limited liability company before the action described in RSA 304-C:166,
then, as to that limited liability company interest, the provisions of
RSA 304-C:160 through RSA 304-C:171 must be followed subject to the
requirements of this section.
                                             
 III. If the member has not ceased to be a member before the action
described in RSA 304-C:166, all rights to be exercised and actions to be
taken by a member under RSA 304-C:161 through RSA 304-C:171 shall be
exercised or taken by the member and not by an transferee of the
member's limited liability company interest.
                                             
 IV. As between the limited liability company and the transferees of
limited liability company interests in the limited liability company,
the actions taken or omitted by the member bind the transferees, and the
following requirements shall apply:
                                             
 (a) Instead of remitting a payment under RSA 304-C:166, the
limited liability company shall forward to the dissenting member:
                                             
 (1) The materials described in RSA 304-C:166, II;
                                             
 (2) An offer to pay the amount listed in the materials, with
that amount to be allocated among and paid to the member and the
transferees of the limited liability company interest according to the
terms of the transfer reflected in the required records; and
                                             
 (3) A statement of that allocation.
                                             
 (b) If the dissenting member accepts the amount of the offer made
under RSA 304-C:166 but disputes the allocation, the dissenter shall
promptly so notify the limited liability company and within 60 days
after the notification commence a proceeding and petition the court to
determine the proper allocation.
                                             
 (c) The dissenting member shall commence the proceeding in
superior court of the county in which the principal office of the
limited liability company or, if none, its registered office, is
located, or in the case of a surviving foreign limited liability company
or other entity that is complying with this section following a merger
with or conversion of a limited liability company, the member shall
commence the proceeding in superior court of the county in this state in
which the last registered office of the limited liability company was
located.
                                             
 V. The petition filed under subparagraph IV(b) shall name as parties
the member, the limited liability company and all transferees of the
member's limited liability interest. Upon being served with the
petition, the limited liability company shall promptly pay into the
court the amount offered under subparagraph IV(a) and shall then be
dismissed from the proceeding.
                                             
 VI. If the dissenter considers the amount offered under subparagraph
IV(a) inadequate, the dissenter may decline the offer and demand payment
under RSA 304-C:169. If the dissenter makes demand for payment, RSA
304-C:170 and RSA 304-C:171 apply with the court having jurisdiction to
determine the correctness of the allocation.
                                             
 VII. If the dissenting member fails to act under RSA 304-C:169,
then:
                                             
 (a) As to the limited liability company, both the member and the
transferees of the member's limited liability company interests are
limited to the amount and allocation offered under paragraph IV; and
                                             
 (b) The limited liability company discharges its obligation of
payment by making payment according to the amount and allocation offered
under paragraph IV.
                                             
 VIII. If the member has ceased to be a member upon the transfer of
the member's limited liability company interest, the transferees of the
member's limited liability company interest shall be entitled to
exercise all rights of the member under RSA 304-C:161 through RSA
304-C:171.

 I. A foreign limited liability company may become a domestic limited
liability company only if the domestication is permitted by the organic
law of the foreign limited liability company. The laws of New Hampshire
shall govern the effect of domesticating in New Hampshire pursuant to
RSA 304-C:205 through RSA 304-C:210.
                                             
 II. A domestic limited liability company may become a foreign
limited liability company if the domestication is permitted by the laws
of the foreign jurisdiction. Regardless of whether the laws of the
foreign jurisdiction require the adoption of a plan of domestication,
the domestication shall be approved by the adoption by the domestic
limited liability company of a plan of domestication in the manner
provided in this subdivision. The laws of the foreign jurisdiction shall
govern the effect of domesticating in that jurisdiction.
                                             
 III. The plan of domestication adopted by a domestic limited
liability company shall include:
                                             
 (a) A statement of the jurisdiction in which the limited
liability company is to be domesticated;
                                             
 (b) The terms and conditions of the domestication;
                                             
 (c) The manner and basis of reclassifying the membership rights
of the limited liability company following its domestication into
membership rights or other securities, obligations, rights to acquire
membership rights or other securities, cash, other property, or any
combination of the foregoing; and
                                             
 (d) Any desired amendments to the certificate of formation or
equivalent foreign statutory document (for purposes of this subdivision,
the "certificate of formation'') of the limited liability company
following its domestication. The plan of domestication may include any
other provision relating to the domestication that may be desired.
                                             
 IV. The plan of domestication may include a provision that the plan
may be amended prior to filing the document required by the laws of this
state or the other jurisdiction to consummate the domestication, except
that subsequent to approval of the plan by the members, the plan may not
be amended to change:
                                             
 (a) The amount or kind of membership rights or other securities,
obligations, rights to acquire membership rights or other securities,
cash, or other property to be received by the members under the plan;
                                             
 (b) The certificate of formation or operating agreement, as they
will be in effect immediately following the domestication, except for
changes permitted by RSA 304-C:35, II or by comparable provisions of the
laws of the other jurisdiction; or
                                             
 (c) Any of the other terms or conditions of the plan if the
change would adversely affect any of the membership rights in any
material respect.
                                             
 V. Terms of a plan of domestication may be made dependent upon facts
objectively ascertainable outside the plan in accordance with the
principles set forth in RSA 293-A:1.20(j).
                                             
 VI. If any debt security, note, or similar evidence of indebtedness
for money borrowed, whether secured or unsecured, or a contract of any
kind, issued, incurred, or signed by a domestic limited liability
company contains a provision applying to a merger of the limited
liability company and the document does not refer to a domestication of
the limited liability company, then the provision shall be deemed to
apply to a domestication of the limited liability company until such
time as the provision is amended subsequent to that date.
                                             
 VII. An operating agreement of a domestic limited liability company
may provide that decisions by the members relating to the limited
liability company's domestications are reserved to specified members or
managers.

company in a foreign jurisdiction:
                                             
 (a) If the approval of the members is to be given at a meeting,
the limited liability company must notify each member, whether or not
entitled to vote, of the meeting of members at which the plan of
domestication is to be submitted for approval. The notice must state
that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider
the plan and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the
plan. The notice shall include or be accompanied by a copy of the
limited liability company's certificate of formation and operating
agreement as they will be in effect immediately after the
domestication.
                                             
 (b) Unless the operating agreement of the limited liability
company requires a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be
present, approval of the plan of domestication requires the approval of
each voting group entitled to vote separately on the plan by a majority
of all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan by that voting group.
                                             
 (c) Separate voting by voting groups is required by each class or
series of membership rights that:
                                             
 (1) Are to be reclassified under the plan of domestication
into other securities, obligations, rights to acquire membership rights
or other securities, cash, other property, or any combination of the
foregoing;
                                             
 (2) Would be entitled to vote as a separate group on a
provision of the plan that, if contained in a proposed amendment to the
certificate of formation or operating agreement, would require action by
separate voting groups; or
                                             
 (3) Is entitled under the certificate of formation or
operating agreement to vote as a voting group to approve an amendment of
the certificate of formation or operating agreement.
                                             
 II. If any provision of the certificate of formation or operating
agreement adopted or entered into applies to a merger of the limited
liability company and that document does not refer to a domestication of
the limited liability company, the provision shall be deemed to apply to
a domestication of the limited liability company until such time as the
provision is amended subsequent to that date.
