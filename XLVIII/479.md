 (a) The affiant is the mortgagor; the mortgagor's executor,

loan secured by the mortgage.
                                             
 (c) The mortgagee received full payment of the loan secured by
the mortgage in accordance with the payoff statement, and the affiant

 (e) The affiant has given the mortgagee at least 15 days' notice
in writing by certified mail, sent to the mortgagee's last known
address, of intention to execute and cause to be recorded an affidavit
in accordance with this section, together with a copy of the proposed
affidavit; and the mortgagee has not delivered a discharge in response
to such notification and the mortgagor has complied with any request
made by the mortgagee for additional payment at least 15 days prior to
the date of the affidavit.
                                             
 II. The affidavit shall include the names and addresses of both the
mortgagor and the mortgagee, the date of the mortgage, and the title
reference. Similar information shall be included with respect to any
recorded assignment of the mortgage.
                                             
 III. The affidavit, when recorded, shall constitute a discharge of
the mortgage and a release of the lien created by the mortgage on the
mortgaged premises.
                                             
 IV. Any person who causes an affidavit to be recorded in accordance
with this section, knowing the information and statements contained in
the affidavit to be false, shall be punished by a fine of not more than

                                             $5,000.
                                             
 V. In this section, the term "payoff statement'' means a written
statement of the amount of the unpaid balance on the mortgage including
principal, interest, and other charges properly assessed pursuant to the
loan documentation of such mortgage and a statement of the interest on a
per diem basis with respect to the unpaid principal balance on the
mortgage. For the purposes of this section, a regular periodic account
statement is not considered a payoff statement unless the mortgagee
expressly states thereon that the statement represents a final payoff
statement and it also contains a per diem rate or amount for calculating
the final mortgage payoff amount.

court seems just.

### Section 479:25

 **479:25 Sale Under the Power. –** Instead of such suit and decree
of sale, the mortgagee or his assignee may, upon breach of the
condition, give such notices and do all such acts as are authorized or
required by the power, including the giving of a foreclosure deed upon
the completion of said foreclosure; but no sale under and by virtue of
such power shall be valid and effectual to foreclose such mortgage
unless the following conditions are complied with:
                                             
 I. Notice of such sale shall be published once a week for 3
successive weeks in some newspaper of general circulation within the
town or county in which the property is situated. In the event that the
mortgaged premises are situated in more than one county, publication in
a newspaper of statewide circulation shall be sufficient. The first
publication shall be not less than 20 days before the date of sale,
calculated by excluding the date of publication of the first notice and
the date of sale.
                                             
 II. (a) A copy of said notice shall be served upon the mortgagor or
sent by registered or certified mail to his or her last known address or
to such person as may be agreed upon in the mortgage at least 25 days
before the sale, or in the case of a residential mortgage, at least 45
days before the sale. The term "mortgagor'' shall include the mortgagor
and any grantee, assignee, devisee or heir of the mortgagor holding a
recorded interest in the mortgaged premises subordinate to the lien of
the mortgage, provided that such interest is recorded at least 30 days,
or in the case of a residential mortgage, at least 50 days, before the
date of the sale, in the registry of deeds for the county in which the
mortgaged premises are situated. In this paragraph, the term
"residential mortgage'' means a mortgage on a dwelling, as defined in
RSA 397-A:1, VI-c. Like notice shall be sent to any person having a lien
of record on the mortgaged premises not less than 21 days before the
sale, provided that the lien is recorded at least 30 days, or in the
case of a residential mortgage, at least 50 days, before the date of the
sale in the registry of deeds. Such notice of sale shall be sufficient
if it fully sets forth the date, time, and place of sale; the town,
county, street or highway and street number, if any, of the mortgaged
premises; the date of the mortgage; the volume and page of the recording
of the mortgage; and the terms of the sale. Any mortgagor or record
lienholder who refuses to accept or claim mailed or served notice or who
frustrates attempts by the mortgagee to give notice of the sale by
failing to give or leave a forwarding address or by other act or
omission shall be deemed to be notified of the sale, provided that such
mortgagee shall have made a good faith effort to provide such notice.
                                             
 (b) Notice of the sale as served on or mailed to the mortgagor
shall include, for owner-occupied dwellings of 4 or fewer dwelling

 "You are hereby notified that you have a right to petition the
superior court for the county in which the mortgaged premises are
situated, with service upon the mortgagee, and upon such bond as the
court may require, to enjoin the scheduled foreclosure sale.'' Failure
to institute such petition and complete service upon the foreclosing
party, or his or her agent, conducting the sale prior to sale shall
thereafter bar any action or right of action of the mortgagor based on
the validity of the foreclosure.

 III. The sale shall be held upon the premises except where a
different place of sale is agreed upon in the mortgage. In the event
that the mortgage shall contain more than one parcel of land, the sale

 IV. No foreclosure sale shall be invalid or ineffectual to foreclose
a mortgage pursuant to this section if any party entitled to be sent
notice and not sent such notice shall, either before or after such
foreclosure sale, waive its right to have been sent such notice, or if
the lien or interest of such party in the mortgaged premises shall at
any time be released or discharged. A waiver of notice authorized or
validated under this section shall be recorded in the registry of deeds
in the county where the property is situated.

after the sale cause the foreclosure deed, a copy of the notice of the
sale, and his affidavit setting forth fully and particularly his acts in
the premises to be recorded in the registry of deeds in the county where
the property is situated; and such affidavit or a duly certified copy of
the record thereof shall be evidence on the question whether the power
of sale was duly executed. If such recording is prevented by order or
stay of any court or law or any provision of the United States
Bankruptcy Code, the time for such recording shall be extended until 10
days after the expiration or removal of such order or stay. If such
recording is, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, made

other encumbrances of record with the register of deeds for said county
intervening between the day of the sale and the time of recording of
said deed and affidavit.
                                             
 III. Title to the foreclosed premises shall not pass to the
purchaser until the time of the recording of the deed and affidavit.

pay the balance of the purchase price according to the terms of the
sale, and at the option of the mortgagee, the down payment, if any,
shall be forfeited and the foreclosure sale shall be void.
