SALE OF SYNTHETIC DRUGS
-----------------------

### Section 359-O:1

 **359-O:1 Purpose. –** The general court has determined that certain
businesses and/or individuals within the state are possessing and
selling certain synthetic drugs which are described in this chapter, and
are potentially dangerous to users and society, and for which the
long-term effects are not yet known. The effects of these substances are
a health concern to the citizens of the state. Not all of the substances
are categorized as illegal controlled substances under state or federal
law. By selling these substances for smoking and ingestion under the
guise of incense, the manufacturers avoid the United States Food and
Drug Administration process for study and approval of such substances
prior to distribution for consumption. In addition, by marketing these
so-called incense products directed at the controlled drug subculture,
the manufacturers and sellers avoid the Schedule I implications of the
federal Controlled Substances Act and the state controlled drug act. The
state has determined that there is no legitimate purpose for the sale,
possession, or use of these substances.

### Section 359-O:6

 **359-O:6 Control of Synthetic Drugs. –**
                                             
 I. The commissioner of the department of health and human services
may add, delete, or otherwise revise the control of synthetic drugs as
defined under RSA 359-O:2, by rule, pursuant to RSA 541-A, after hearing
and after consulting with the pharmacy board. In making a determination
regarding a synthetic drug, the commissioner shall consider the
following:
                                             
 (a) Actual or relative potential for abuse;
                                             
 (b) Scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known;
                                             
 (c) State of current scientific knowledge regarding the
substance;
                                             
 (d) History and current pattern of abuse;
                                             
 (e) Scope, duration, and significance of abuse;
                                             
 (f) Risk to the public health;
                                             
 (g) Potential of the substance to produce psychic or physical
dependence liability; and
                                             
 (h) Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a
substance already controlled under this chapter.
                                             
 II. After considering the factors in paragraph I, the commissioner
shall make findings relative to the substance and adopt a rule
controlling the substance if he or she finds the substance has a
potential for abuse.
                                             
 III. In addition to the provisions of RSA 541-A, the commissioner
shall give due notice of the time, place, and purpose of all hearings
required under this chapter to podiatrists, osteopaths, hospitals,
pharmacists, physicians, dentists, veterinarians, advanced practice
registered nurses, optometrists, laboratories, registered manufacturers,
and suppliers and to the general public by such means as he or she shall
deem adequate. From and after the hearing date, the sale or dispensation
(except by prescription) of a drug or chemical containing any quantity
of such substance as is the subject matter of the hearing shall be
suspended pending a determination as to whether such substance is to be
designated as a controlled drug. Designation as a controlled drug shall
result in the continued suspension of the sale or dispensation (except
by prescription) of any drug or chemical containing any quantity of such
synthetic drug until the effective date of the designation. The
substance shall thereafter be included in the definition of synthetic
drug pursuant to this chapter. If any substance is so designated, the
commissioner shall publish the designation in a newspaper of general
circulation in the state once each week for 3 successive weeks or on the
department's public Internet website.
                                             
 IV. Substances which are precursors of the controlled precursor
shall not be subject to control solely because they are precursors of
the controlled precursor.
                                             
 V. If any substance is designated, rescheduled, or deleted as a
controlled substance under federal law and notice thereof is given to
the commissioner, the commissioner shall similarly control the substance
under this chapter after the expiration of 30 days from publication in
the Federal Register of a final order designating a substance as a
controlled substance or rescheduling or deleting a synthetic drug,
unless, within that 30-day period, the commissioner objects to
inclusion, rescheduling, or deletion. In that case, the commissioner
shall publish the reasons for objection and afford all interested
persons an opportunity to be heard. At the conclusion of the hearing,
the commissioner shall publish a decision, which shall be final unless
altered by law. Upon publication of objection to inclusion,
rescheduling, or deletion under this chapter by the commissioner,
control under this chapter shall be stayed until the commissioner
publishes a decision.
                                             
 VI. Substances shall be listed by whatever official, common, usual,
chemical, or trade name is designated.
                                             
 VII. This section shall not apply to nonprescription or proprietary
medicines as defined in RSA 318:1, XVIII.

application thereof to any person, business, or circumstances is held
invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or
applications of the chapter which can be given effect without the
invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this
chapter are declared to be severable.
