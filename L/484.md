WATER MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION COMPACTS
----------------------------------------

Connecticut River Flood Control Compact
---------------------------------------

### Section 484:1

 **484:1 Interstate Compact. –** The governor and council, on behalf
of this state, are authorized to enter into and execute a compact
substantially in the following form with the states of Vermont,
Massachusetts and Connecticut, by and through the commissioners or duly
authorized representatives appointed or who may be appointed under or by
virtue of a law of the legislatures of the respective states, and the
legislature signifies in advance its approval and ratification of such
compact, so entered into, such approval and ratification to be effective
as set forth in this compact:
                                             
 Whereas, the federal government exercises jurisdiction over the
nation's navigable rivers and their tributaries through passage of the
Flood Control Act of 1936 and various amendments to that act; and
                                             
 Whereas, these acts provide for construction by the United States of
dams for flood control and, where feasible, in addition to flood
control, for storage of water to be used for irrigation, recreation or
hydroelectric power or for any of these purposes; and
                                             
 Whereas, the Connecticut is an interstate river and control of major
floods on it can be obtained only by the construction of dams by the
United States under authorization of the above mentioned acts; and
                                             
 Whereas, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the states of
Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont recognize that it is in the
interest of their general welfare that the United States construct in
the Connecticut River Valley a comprehensive system of local protection
works and dams and reservoirs to control floods and prevent loss of life
and property, the disruption of orderly processes and the impairment of
commerce between the aforesaid states; and
                                             
 Whereas, the United States has constructed dikes, flood walls and
other local protection works at Hartford and East Hartford in the state
of Connecticut, and at Springfield, Riverdale, West Springfield,
Chicopee, Northampton, Holyoke, and Springdale in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and dams and reservoirs for the storage of flood waters
at Knightville, Birch Hill and Tully in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, at Surry Mountain in the state of New Hampshire and at
Union Village in the state of Vermont and has reached agreements with
the state in which these facilities are located for construction of dams
and reservoirs for the storage of flood waters at Barre Falls in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and at Ball Mountain and at Townshend in
the state of Vermont; and
                                             
 Whereas, the Congress has at various times authorized construction
by the United States of other dams and reservoirs for the storage of
flood waters in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and in the states of
New Hampshire and Vermont and has more recently instructed the Corps of
Engineers to determine what additional local protection works and dams
and reservoirs are required for a comprehensive system to control floods
in the Connecticut River and its tributaries; and
                                             
 Whereas, it is believed that such a comprehensive flood control
system should include dams and reservoirs controlling flood runoff from
approximately 25 percent of the total drainage area of the Connecticut
River above Hartford, Connecticut, and strategically located in
reference to characteristics of tributaries and to damage centers; and
                                             
 Whereas, construction by the United States of additional dams and
reservoirs in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and in the states of New
Hampshire and Vermont to complete such a comprehensive flood control
system will remove from the tax rolls of local governments of those
states such property as is acquired by the United States and may work
other hardships against the people of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and
Vermont; and
                                             
 Whereas, it is highly desirable that any flood control dam and
reservoir constructed by the United States in the Connecticut River
Valley have the approval of the state in which it is located and that
states benefiting from construction of such dam and reservoir make
reimbursement for such loss of taxes and for such hardships; and
                                             
 Whereas, a comprehensive system for the prevention of destructive
floods and for water resources utilization in the Connecticut River
Valley can best be accomplished by cooperation between the several
states in the valley and by and through a common and joint agency of
said several states;
                                             
 Now, therefore, the said Commonwealth of Massachusetts and states of
Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont do enter into the following
compact, to-wit:

**Article I**


                                             
 The principal purposes of this compact are: (a) to promote
interstate comity among and between the signatory states; (b) to assure
adequate storage capacity for impounding the waters of the Connecticut
River and its tributaries for the protection of life and property from
floods; and (c) to provide a joint or common agency through which the
signatory states, while promoting, protecting and preserving to each the
local interest and sovereignty of the respective signatory states, may
more effectively cooperate in accomplishing the object of flood control
and water resources utilization in the basin of the Connecticut River
and its tributaries.

**Article II**


                                             
 There is created "The Connecticut River Valley Flood Control
Commission,'' referred to in this compact as the "commission,'' which
shall consist of 12 members, 3 of whom shall be residents of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 3 of whom shall be residents of the state
of Connecticut, 3 of whom shall be residents of the state of New
Hampshire, and 3 of whom shall be residents of the state of Vermont.
                                             
 The members of the commission shall be chosen by their respective
states in such manner and for such term as may be fixed and determined
from time to time by the law of each of said states respectively by
which they are appointed. A member of the commission may be removed or
suspended from office as provided by the law of the state for which he
shall be appointed, and any vacancy occurring in the commission shall be
filled in accordance with the laws of the state in which such vacancy
exists.
                                             
 A majority of the members from each state shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business, the exercise of any of its powers or
the performance of any of its duties, but no action of the commission
shall be binding unless at least 2 of the members from each state shall
vote in favor of such action.
                                             
 The compensation of members of the commission shall be fixed,
determined, and paid by the state which they respectively represent. All
necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties shall be
paid from the funds of the commission.
                                             
 The commission shall elect from its members a chairman,
vice-chairman, clerk and treasurer. Such treasurer shall furnish to the
commission, at its expense, a bond with corporate surety, to be approved
by the commission, in such amount as the commission may determine,
conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties.
                                             
 The commission shall adopt suitable bylaws and shall make such rules
and regulations as it may deem advisable not inconsistent with laws of
the United States, of the signatory states or with any rules or
regulations lawfully promulgated under this compact.
                                             
 The commission shall make an annual report to the governor and
legislature of each of the signatory states, setting forth in detail the
operations and transactions conducted by it pursuant to this compact.
                                             
 The commission shall keep a record of all its meetings and
proceedings, contracts and accounts, and shall maintain a suitable
office, where its maps, plans, documents, records and accounts shall be
kept, subject to public inspection at such times and under such
regulations as the commission shall determine.

**Article III**


                                             
 The commission shall constitute a body, both corporate and politic,
with full power and authority: (1) to sue and be sued; (2) to have a
seal and alter the same at pleasure; (3) to appoint and employ such
agents and employees as may be required in the proper performance of the
duties committed to it and to fix and determine their qualifications,
duties and compensation; (4) to enter into such contracts and agreements
and to do and perform any and all other acts, matters and things as may
be necessary and essential to the full and complete performance of the
powers and duties committed to and imposed upon it and as may be
incidental to such powers and duties; and (5) to have such additional
powers and duties as may hereafter be delegated to or imposed upon it
from time to time by the action of the legislature of any of said
states, concurred in by the legislatures of the other states and by the
Congress of the United States.
                                             
 The commission shall make, or cause to be made, such studies as it
may deem necessary, in cooperation with the Corps of Engineers and other
federal agencies, for the development of a comprehensive plan for flood
control and for utilization of the water resources of the Connecticut
River Valley.
                                             
 The commission shall not pledge the credit of the signatory states
or any of them.

**Article IV**

**Article V**


                                             
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts agrees to reimburse the state of
New Hampshire 50 percent and the state of Vermont 50 percent of the
amount of taxes lost to their political subdivisions by reason of
ownership by the United States of lands, rights or other property
therein for the flood control dams and reservoirs at Surry Mountain in
New Hampshire and at Union Village in Vermont.
                                             
 The state of Connecticut agrees to reimburse the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts 40 percent, the state of New Hampshire 40 percent and the
state of Vermont 40 percent of the amount of taxes lost to their
political subdivisions by reason of ownership by the United States of
lands, rights or other property therein for the flood control dams and
reservoirs at Tully, at Knightville and at Birch Hill in Massachusetts,
at Surry Mountain in New Hampshire and at Union Village in Vermont.
                                             
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts agrees to reimburse the state of
New Hampshire 50 percent and the state of Vermont 50 percent of the
amount of taxes lost to their political subdivisions by reason of
acquisition and ownership by the United States of lands, rights or other
property therein for construction in the future of any flood control dam
and reservoir specified in Article IV and also for any other flood
control dam and reservoir hereafter constructed by the United States in
the Connecticut River Valley.
                                             
 The state of Connecticut agrees to reimburse the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts 40 percent, the state of New Hampshire 40 percent and the
state of Vermont 40 percent of the amount of taxes lost to their
political subdivisions by reason of acquisition and ownership by the
United States of lands, rights or other property therein for
construction in the future of any flood control dam and reservoir
specified in Article IV and also for any other flood control dam and
reservoir hereafter constructed by the United States in the Connecticut
River Valley.
                                             
 Annually, not later than November 1 of each year, the commission
shall determine the loss of taxes resulting to political subdivisions of
each signatory state by reason of acquisition and ownership therein by
the United States of lands, rights or other property in connection with
each flood control dam and reservoir for which provision for tax
reimbursement has been made in the four paragraphs next above. Such
losses of taxes as determined by the commission shall be based on the
tax rate then current in each such political subdivision and on the
average assessed valuation for a period of 5 years prior to the
acquisition by the United States of such property; provided that
whenever a political subdivision in which a flood control dam and
reservoir or portion of such dam or reservoir is located shall have made
a general revaluation of property subject to the annual municipal taxes
of such subdivision, the commission may use such revaluation for the
purpose of determining the amount of taxes for which reimbursement shall
be made. Using the percentage of payment agreed to in said four
paragraphs, the commission shall then compute the sum, if any, due from
each signatory state to each other signatory state and shall send a
notice to the treasurer of each signatory state setting forth in detail
the sums, if any, each is to pay to and to receive from each other
signatory state in reimbursement of tax losses.
                                             
 Each signatory state on receipt of formal notification from the
commission of the sum which it is to pay in reimbursement for tax losses
shall, not later than July 1 of the following year, make its payment for
such tax losses to the signatory state in which such loss or losses
occur, except that in case of the first annual payment for tax losses at
any dam or reservoir such payment shall be made by payor states not
later than July 1 of the year in which the next regular session of its
legislature is held. Payment by a signatory state of its share of
reimbursement for taxes in accordance with formal notification received
from the commission shall be a complete and final discharge of all
liability by the payor state to the payee state for each flood control
dam and reservoir within the payee state for the time specified in such
formal notification. Each payee signatory state shall have full
responsibility for distributing or expending all such sums received, and
no agency or political subdivision shall have any claim against any
signatory state other than the payee state, nor against the commission
relative to tax losses covered by such payments.
                                             
 Whenever a state which makes reimbursement for tax losses and a
state which receives such reimbursement from it shall agree, through the
commission, on a lump sum payment in lieu of annual payments and such
lump sum payment has been made and received, the requirement that the
commission annually shall determine the tax losses, compute sums due
from each state and send notice thereof to the treasurer of each state
shall no longer apply to the aforesaid states with respect to any flood
control dam and reservoir for which lump sum payment has been made and
received.
                                             
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the state of Connecticut each
agrees to pay its respective share in reimbursement, as determined by
the commission under the procedure following, for economic losses and
damages occurring by reason of ownership of property by the United
States for construction and operation of a flood control dam and
reservoir at any site specified in Article IV, and for any other flood
control dam and reservoir constructed hereafter by the United States in
the Connecticut River Valley; provided, however, that no reimbursement
shall be made for speculative losses and damages or losses or damages
for which the United States is liable.
                                             
 On receipt of information from the chief of engineers that request
is to be made for funds for the purpose of preparing detailed plans and
specifications for any flood control dam and reservoir proposed to be
constructed in the Connecticut River Valley, including those specified
in Article IV, the commission shall make an estimate of the amount of
taxes which would be lost to and of economic losses and damages which
would occur in political subdivisions of the signatory state in which
such dam and reservoir would be located, wholly or in part, by reason of
acquisition and ownership by the United States of lands, rights or other
property for the construction and operation of such flood control dam
and reservoir and shall decide whether the flood control benefits to be
derived in the signatory states from such flood control dam and
reservoir, both by itself and as a unit of a comprehensive flood control
plan, justifies, in the opinion of the commission, the assumption by
signatory states of the obligation to make reimbursement for loss of
taxes and for economic losses and damages. Such estimate and decision
shall thereafter be reviewed by the commission at 5-year intervals until
such time as the United States shall have acquired title to the site of
such flood control dam or plans for its construction are abandoned. The
commission shall notify the governor, the members of the United States
Senate and the members of the United States House of Representatives
from each signatory state and the chief of engineers as to the
commission's decision and as to any change in such decision.
                                             
 On receipt of information from the chief of engineers that any flood
control dam and reservoir is to be constructed, reconstructed, altered
or used for any purpose in addition to flood control, including those
flood control dams and reservoirs previously constructed and those
specified in Article IV, the commission shall make a separate estimate
of the amount of taxes which would be lost to and of economic losses and
damages which would occur in political subdivisions of the signatory
state in which such dam and reservoir would be located, wholly or in
part, by reason of acquisition and ownership by the United States of
lands, rights or other property for the construction and operation of
such dam and reservoir in excess of the estimated amount of taxes which
would be lost and of the economic losses and damages which would occur
if the dam were constructed and operated for flood control only and the
commission shall decide the extent to which, in its opinion, the
signatory states would be justified in making reimbursement for loss of
taxes and for economic losses and damages in addition to reimbursement
for such dam and reservoir if constructed and used for flood control
only. Such estimate and decision shall thereafter be reviewed by the
commission at 5-year intervals until such time as such dam and reservoir
shall be so constructed, reconstructed, altered or used or plans for
such construction, reconstruction, alteration or use are abandoned. The
commission shall notify the governor, the members of the United States
Senate and the members of the United States House of Representatives
from each signatory state as to the commission's decision and as to any
change in such decision.
                                             
 Within 30 days after acquisition by the United States of the site of
any flood control dam, the commission shall proceed to make a final
determination of economic losses and damages occasioned by such dam and
reservoir. The commission shall not include in such determination either
speculative losses and damages or losses and damages for which the
United States is liable.
                                             
 The commission shall compute the share the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and the state of Connecticut shall each pay to the state
in which such dam or reservoir is located by multiplying the sum of such
losses and damages, as previously determined, by the percentage of flood
control benefits which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the state
of Connecticut each receives, in the allocation by states, of the flood
control benefits resulting from the dam and reservoir.
                                             
 The commission shall send a notice to the treasurer of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and to the treasurer of the state of
Connecticut setting forth in detail the sum, if any, each is to pay to
the state in which such dam and reservoir is located in reimbursement
for economic losses and damages and shall also send such notice to the
treasurer of the state in which such dam and reservoir is located.
                                             
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the state of Connecticut on
receipt of such formal notification by the commission shall each pay its
share of such economic losses or damages to the signatory states in
which such losses or damages occur. Full payment by either state of the
sum specified in such formal notification from the commission as to the
amount of economic losses and damages for which such state is to make
reimbursement shall be a complete and final discharge of all liability
by the payor state to the payee state for economic losses and damages
for each flood control dam and reservoir within the payee state
designated in such formal notification. Each payee signatory state shall
have full responsibility for distributing or expending all such sums
received and no agency, political subdivision, private person,
partnership, firm, association or corporation shall have any claim
against any signatory state other than the payee state, nor against the
commission relative to such economic losses and damages.
                                             
 A signatory state may, in agreement with the commission and the
chief of engineers, acquire title or option to acquire title to any or
all lands, rights or other property required for any flood control dam
and reservoir within its boundaries and transfer such titles or options
to the United States. Whenever the fair cost to said signatory state for
such titles or options, as determined by the commission, is greater than
the amount received therefor from the United States, the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and the state of Connecticut shall each pay its share of
such excess cost to said signatory state, such share to be determined by
the commission in accordance with procedure contained in this compact
for determining reimbursement for economic losses and damages.
                                             
 Whenever the commission shall not agree, within a reasonable time or
within 60 days after a formal request from the governor of any signatory
state, concerning reimbursement for loss of taxes or for economic losses
and damages at any flood control dam and reservoir previously or
hereafter constructed by the United States in the Connecticut River
Valley, or concerning the extent, if any, to which reimbursement shall
be made for additional loss of taxes and for additional economic losses
and damages caused by construction, reconstruction, alteration or use of
any such dam for purposes other than flood control, the governor of each
signatory state shall designate a person from his state as a member of a
board of arbitration, hereinafter called the board, and the members so
designated shall choose one additional member who shall be chairman of
such board. Whenever the members appointed by the governors to such
board shall not agree within 60 days on such additional member of the
board, the governors of such signatory states shall jointly designate
the additional member. The board shall by majority vote decide the
question referred to it and shall do so in accordance with the
provisions of this compact concerning such reimbursement. The decision
of the board on each question referred to it concerning reimbursement
for loss of taxes and for economic losses and damages shall be binding
on the commission and on each signatory state, notwithstanding any other
provision of this compact.

**Article VI**


                                             
 Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed as a limitation
upon the authority of the United States.

Merrimack River Flood Control Compact
-------------------------------------

### Section 484:7

 **484:7 Interstate Compact. –** The governor and council, on behalf
of this state, are authorized to enter into and execute a compact
substantially in the following form with the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, by and through the commissioners or duly authorized
representatives appointed or who may be appointed under or by virtue of
a law of the legislature of the state of New Hampshire, and the
legislature hereby signifies in advance its approval and ratification of
such compact, so entered into, such approval and ratification to be
effective as set forth in this compact:
                                             
 Whereas, the federal government exercises jurisdiction over the
nation's navigable rivers and their tributaries through passage of the
Flood Control Act of 1936 and various other amendments to that act; and
                                             
 Whereas, these acts provide for construction by the United States of
dams for flood control and, where feasible, in addition to flood
control, for storage of water to be used for irrigation, recreation or
hydroelectric power or for any of these purposes; and
                                             
 Whereas, the Merrimack is an interstate river and control of major
floods on it can be obtained only by the construction of dams by the
United States under authorization of the above-mentioned acts; and
                                             
 Whereas, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the state of New
Hampshire recognize that it is in the interest of their general welfare
that the United States construct in the Merrimack River Valley a
comprehensive system of local protection works and dams and reservoirs
to control floods and prevent loss of life and property, the disruption
of orderly processes and the impairment of commerce between the said 2
states; and
                                             
 Whereas, the United States has constructed dikes, flood walls and
other local protection works at Nashua in the state of New Hampshire and
at Haverhill, Lowell and Fitchburg in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
and dams and reservoirs for the storage of flood waters at Franklin
Falls, Peterborough and at Webster in the state of New Hampshire, and
has prepared designs for dikes and flood walls and other local
protection works at Lawrence and North Andover in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts; and
                                             
 Whereas, the Congress has at various times authorized construction
by the United States of other dams and reservoirs for the storage of
flood waters in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and in the state of
New Hampshire and has more recently instructed the Corps of Engineers to
determine what additional local protection works and dams and reservoirs
are required for a comprehensive system to control floods in the
Merrimack River and its tributaries; and
                                             
 Whereas, it is believed that such a comprehensive flood control
system should include dams and reservoirs controlling flood runoff from
approximately 30 percent of the total drainage area of the Merrimack
River Basin and strategically located in reference to characteristics of
tributaries and to damage centers; and
                                             
 Whereas, dams and reservoirs to control 30 percent of flood runoff
will be located in the state of New Hampshire and the major benefits
from such dams and reservoirs will accrue to the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts; and
                                             
 Whereas, construction by the United States of additional dams and
reservoirs in the state of New Hampshire to complete such a
comprehensive flood control system will remove from the tax rolls of
local governments of the state of New Hampshire such property as is
acquired by the United States and may work other hardships against the
people of New Hampshire; and
                                             
 Whereas, it is highly desirable that any flood control dam and
reservoir constructed by the United States in the Merrimack River Valley
have the approval of the state of New Hampshire and the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts benefiting from
construction of such dam and reservoir make reimbursement for such loss
of taxes and for such hardships; and
                                             
 Whereas, a comprehensive system for the prevention of destructive
floods and for water resources utilization in the Merrimack River Valley
can best be accomplished by cooperation between the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and the state of New Hampshire and by and through a common
and joint agency of said 2 states;
                                             
 Now, therefore, the said Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the state
of New Hampshire do enter into the following compact, to wit:

**Article I**


                                             
 The principal purposes of this compact are: (a) to promote
interstate comity among and between the signatory states; (b) to provide
adequate storage capacity for impounding the waters of the Merrimack
River and its tributaries for the protection of life and property from
floods; and (c) to provide a joint or common agency through which the
signatory states, while promoting, protecting and preserving to each the
local interest and sovereignty of the respective signatory states, may
more effectively cooperate in accomplishing the object of flood control
and water resources utilization in the basin of the Merrimack River and
its tributaries.

**Article II**


                                             
 There is created "The Merrimack River Valley Flood Control
Commission,'' referred to in this compact as the "commission,'' which
shall consist of 6 members, 3 of whom shall be residents of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and one of whom shall be a resident of the
Merrimack Valley, and 3 of whom shall be residents of the state of New
Hampshire.
                                             
 The members of the commission shall be chosen by their respective
states in such manner and for such term as may be fixed and determined
from time to time by the law of each of said states, respectively, by
which they are appointed. A member of the commission may be removed or
suspended from office as provided by the law of the state from which he
shall be appointed, and any vacancy occurring in the commission shall be
filled in accordance with the laws of the state in which such vacancy
exists.
                                             
 A majority of the members of each state shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business, the exercise of any powers or the
performance of any duties, but no action of the commission shall be
binding unless at least 2 members from each state shall vote in favor of
such action.
                                             
 The compensation of members of the commission shall be fixed,
determined, and paid by the state which they respectively represent. All
necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties shall be
paid from the funds of the commission.
                                             
 The commission shall elect from its members a chairman,
vice-chairman, clerk and treasurer. Such treasurer shall furnish to the
commission, at its expense, a bond with corporate surety, to be approved
by the commission, in such amount as the commission may determine,
conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties.
                                             
 The commission shall adopt suitable bylaws and shall make such rules
and regulations as it may deem advisable not inconsistent with laws of
the United States, of the signatory states or with any rules or
regulations lawfully promulgated thereunder.
                                             
 The commission shall make an annual report to the governor and
legislature of each of the signatory states, setting forth in detail the
operations and transactions conducted by it pursuant to this compact.
                                             
 The commission shall keep a record of all its meetings and
proceedings, contracts and accounts, and shall maintain a suitable
office, where its maps, plans, documents, records and accounts shall be
kept, subject to public inspection at such times and under such
regulations as the commission shall determine.

**Article III**


                                             
 The commission shall constitute a body, both corporate and politic,
with full power and authority: (1) to sue and be sued; (2) to have a
seal and alter the same at pleasure; (3) to appoint and employ such
agents and employees as may be required in the proper performance of the
duties committed to it and to fix and determine their qualifications,
duties and compensation; (4) to enter into such contracts and agreements
and to do and perform any and all other acts, matters and things as may
be necessary and essential to the full and complete performance of the
powers and duties hereby committed to and imposed upon it and as may be
incidental thereto; and (5) to have such additional powers and duties as
may hereafter be delegated to or imposed upon it from time to time by
the action of the legislature of either of said states, concurred in by
the legislature of the other state and by the Congress of the United
States.
                                             
 The commission shall make, or cause to be made, such studies as it
may deem necessary, in cooperation with the Corps of Engineers and other
federal agencies, for the development of a comprehensive plan for flood
control and for utilization of the water resources of the Merrimack
River Valley.
                                             
 The commission shall not pledge the credit of the signatory states
or either of them.

**Article IV**


                                             
 The state of New Hampshire in which is located the site of each of
the following dams and reservoirs agrees to the construction by the
United States of each such dam and reservoir in accordance with
authorization by the Congress:
                                             
 (1) At West Hopkinton on the Contoocook River, controlling a
drainage area of approximately 426 square miles, and near East Weare, on
the north branch of the Piscataquog River, controlling a drainage area
of approximately 64 square miles, and providing flood control storage
for approximately 6 inches of runoff over both said drainage areas; and
                                             
 (2) Near Loudon on the Soucook River, controlling a drainage area
of approximately 77 square miles and providing flood control storage for
approximately 6 inches of runoff over said drainage area.

**Article V**


                                             
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts agrees to reimburse the state of
New Hampshire 70 percent of the amount of taxes lost by reason of
acquisition and ownership by the United States of lands, rights or other
property therein for the flood control dams and reservoirs at Franklin
Falls, Blackwater and West Peterborough, and for construction in the
future of any flood control dam and reservoir specified in Article IV,
and also for any other flood control dam and reservoir constructed in
the future by the United States in the Merrimack River Valley.
                                             
 Annually, not later than November 1 of each year, the commission
shall determine the loss of taxes resulting to political subdivisions of
the state of New Hampshire by reason of acquisition and ownership
therein by the United States of lands, rights or other property in
connection with each flood control dam and reservoir for which provision
for tax reimbursement has been made in the preceding paragraphs. Such
losses of taxes as determined by the commission shall be based on the
tax rate then current in each such political subdivision and on the
average assessed valuation for a period of 5 years prior to the
acquisition by the United States of such property; provided, that
whenever a political subdivision wherein a flood control dam and
reservoir or portion thereof is located shall have made a general
revaluation of property subject to the annual municipal taxes of such
subdivision, the commission may use such revaluation for the purpose of
determining the amount of taxes for which reimbursement shall be made in
the paragraph next above. Using the percentage of payment agreed to in
said paragraph, the commission shall then compute the sum, if any, due
from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to the state of New Hampshire and
shall send notice to the treasurer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
setting forth in detail the sums, if any, to be paid to New Hampshire in
reimbursement of tax losses due from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
to the state of New Hampshire.
                                             
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, on receipt of formal notification
from the commission of the sum which it is to pay in reimbursement for
tax losses, shall, not later than July 1 of the following year, make its
payment for such tax losses to the state of New Hampshire, except that
in case of the first annual payment for tax losses at any dam or
reservoir such payment shall be made by the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts not later than July 1 of the year in which the next
regular session of its legislature is held.
                                             
 Payment by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of its share of
reimbursement for taxes in accordance with formal notification received
from the commission shall be a complete and final discharge of all
liability of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to the state of New
Hampshire for each flood control dam and reservoir within the State of
New Hampshire for the time specified in such formal notification. The
state of New Hampshire shall have full responsibility for distributing
or expending all such sums received, and no agency or political
subdivision shall have any claim against the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, nor against the commission relative to tax losses covered
by such payments.
                                             
 Whenever the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the state of New
Hampshire shall agree, through the commission, on a lump sum payment in
lieu of annual payments and such lump sum payment has been made and
received, the requirement that the commission annually shall determine
the tax losses, compute sums due from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
and send notice of such sums to the treasurer of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts shall no longer apply to the 2 states with respect to any
flood control dam and reservoir for which lump sum payment has been made
and received.
                                             
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts agrees to pay the state of New
Hampshire its respective share in reimbursement, as determined by the
commission under the procedure following, for economic losses and
damages occurring by reason of ownership of property by the United
States, for construction and operation of a flood control dam and
reservoir at any site specified in Article IV, and for any other flood
control dam and reservoir constructed hereafter by the United States in
the Merrimack River Valley, provided, that no reimbursement shall be
made for speculative losses and damages or losses or damages for which
the United States is liable.
                                             
 On receipt of information from the chief of engineers that request
is to be made for funds for the purpose of preparing detailed plans and
specifications for any flood control dam and reservoir proposed to be
constructed in the Merrimack River Valley, including those specified in
Article IV, the commission shall make an estimate of the amount of taxes
which would be lost to and of economic losses and damages which would
occur in political subdivisions of the state of New Hampshire in which
such dam and reservoir would be located, wholly or in part, by reason of
acquisition and ownership by the United States of lands, rights or other
property for the construction and operation of such flood control dam
and reservoir and shall decide whether the flood control benefits to be
derived in the signatory states from such flood control dam and
reservoir, both by itself and as a unit of a comprehensive flood control
plan, justifies, in the opinion of the commission, the assumption by a
signatory state of the obligation to make reimbursement for loss of
taxes and for economic losses and damages. Such estimate and decision
shall thereafter be reviewed by the commission at 5-year intervals until
such time as the United States shall have acquired title to the site of
such flood control dam or plans for its construction are abandoned. The
commission shall notify the governor, the members of the United States
Senate and the members of the United States House of Representatives
from each signatory state and the chief of engineers as to the
commission's decision and as to any change in such decision.
                                             
 On receipt of information from the chief of engineers that any flood
control dam and reservoir is to be constructed, reconstructed, altered
or used for any purpose in addition to flood control, including those
flood control dams and reservoirs previously constructed and those
specified in Article IV, the commission shall make a separate estimate
of the amount of taxes which would be lost to and of economic losses and
damages which would occur in political subdivisions of the signatory
state in which such dam and reservoir would be located, wholly or in
part, by reason of acquisition and ownership by the United States of
lands, rights or other property for the construction and operation of
such dam and reservoir in excess of the estimated amount of taxes which
would be lost and of the economic losses and damages which would occur
if the dam were constructed and operated for flood control only and the
commission shall decide the extent to which, in its opinion, the
signatory states would be justified in making reimbursement for loss of
taxes and for economic losses and damages in addition to reimbursement
for such dam and reservoir if constructed and used for flood control
only. Such estimate and decision shall thereafter be reviewed by the
commission at 5-year intervals until such time as such dam and reservoir
shall be so constructed, reconstructed, altered or used or plans for
such construction, reconstruction, alterations or use are abandoned. The
commission shall notify the governor, the members of the United States
Senate and the members of the United States House of Representatives
from each signatory state as to the commission's decision and as to any
change in such decision.
                                             
 Within 30 days after acquisition by the United States of the site of
any flood control dam, the commission shall proceed to make a final
determination of economic losses and damages occasioned by such dam and
reservoir. The commission shall not include in such determination either
speculative losses and damages or losses and damages for which the
United States is liable.
                                             
 The commission shall compute the share the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts shall pay to the state of New Hampshire by multiplying the
sum of such losses and damages, as previously determined, by the
percentage of flood control benefits which the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts receives of the flood control benefits resulting from the
dam and reservoir.
                                             
 The commission shall send a notice to the treasurer of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, setting forth in detail the sum, if any,
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is to pay to the state of New
Hampshire in reimbursement for economic losses and damages and shall
also send such notice to the treasurer of the state of New Hampshire.
                                             
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, on receipt of such formal
notification by the commission, shall pay its share of such economic
losses or damages to the state of New Hampshire. Full payment by the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts of the sum specified in such formal
notification from the commission as to the amount of economic losses and
damages for which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is to make
reimbursement shall be a complete and final discharge of all liability
by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to the state of New Hampshire for
economic losses and damages for each flood control dam and reservoir
within the said state designated in such formal notification. The state
of New Hampshire shall have full responsibility for distributing or
expending all such sums received, and no agency, political subdivision,
private person, partnership, firm, association nor corporation shall
have any claim against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, nor against
the commission relative to such economic losses and damages.
                                             
 The state of New Hampshire may, in agreement with the commission and
the chief of engineers, acquire title or option to acquire title to any
or all lands, rights or other property required for any flood control
dam and reservoir within its boundaries, and transfer such titles or
options to the United States. Whenever the fair cost to said signatory
state for such titles or options, as determined by the commission, is
greater than the amount received therefor from the United States, the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts shall pay its share of such excess cost to
said state of New Hampshire, such share to be determined by the
commission in accordance with procedure contained in this compact for
determining reimbursement for economic losses and damages.
                                             
 Whenever the commission shall not agree, within a reasonable time or
within 60 days after a formal request from the governor of the state of
New Hampshire or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, concerning
reimbursement for loss of taxes or for economic losses and damages at
any flood control dam and reservoir previously or hereafter constructed
by the United States in the Merrimack River Valley, or concerning the
extent, if any, to which reimbursement shall be made for additional loss
of taxes and for additional economic losses and damages caused by
construction, reconstruction, alteration or use of any such dam for
purposes other than flood control, the governor of each signatory state
shall designate a person from his state as a member of a board of
arbitration, hereinafter called the board, and the members so designated
shall choose one additional member who shall be chairman of such board.
Whenever the members appointed by the governors to such board shall not
agree within 60 days on such additional member of the board, the

Northeastern Water and Related Land Resources Compact
-----------------------------------------------------

### Section 484:13

 **484:13 Ratification. –** The governor on behalf of the state is
authorized to enter into a compact with any 2 or more of the states of
Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, Vermont and the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts as follows:

**Article I**

**Findings**


                                             
 The northeastern part of the United States is by virtue of
geographic location and other characteristics a great natural resource
area which, with more intense use of natural resources, increasingly
requires coordinated planning as a basic ingredient of effective
resource management and orderly growth of the region. The work of the
New England-New York Interagency Committee demonstrated that a
continuation and furtherance of activities such as those undertaken by
it would be of great value. To this end, it is the intent of this
compact to establish and provide for the operation of a joint agency for
the northeast.

**Article II**

**Purpose**


                                             
 It is the purpose of this compact to provide, in the northeastern
region, improved facilities and procedures for the coordination of the
policies, programs, and activities of the United States, the several
states, and private persons or entities in the field of water and
related land resources, and to study, investigate, and plan the
development and use of the same and conservation of such water and
related land resources; to provide means by which conflicts may be
resolved; to provide procedures for coordination of the interests of all
public and private agencies, persons and entities in the field of water
and related land resources; and to provide an organization for
cooperation in such coordination on both the federal and state levels of
government.

**Article III**

**Creation of Commission**


                                             
 There is created the Northeastern Resources Commission, hereinafter
called the commission.

**Article IV**

**Membership**


                                             
 The commission shall consist of one member from each party state to
be appointed and to serve, in accordance with and subject to the laws of
the state which he represents, and 7 members representing departments or
agencies of the United States having principal responsibilities for
water and related land resources development to be appointed and to
serve in such manner as may be provided by the laws of the United
States.

**Article V**

**Functions**


                                             
 It shall be the responsibility of the commission to recommend to the
states and the United States, or any intergovernmental agency, changes
in law or policy which would promote coordination, or resolution of
problems, in the field of water and related land resources. The efforts
of the commission in coordination of work and resolution of conflicts
may be directed towards all state and federal activities involved in
water and related land resources development responsibilities and shall
include coordination of the following:
                                             
 (1) Collection and interpretation of basic data;
                                             
 (2) Investigation and planning of water and related land
resources projects;
                                             
 (3) Programming (including scheduling) of water and related land
resources construction and development;
                                             
 (4) Encouraging of the referral of plans or proposals for
resources projects to the commission.
                                             
 The commission shall use qualified public and private agencies to
make investigations and conduct research in the field of water and
related land resources, but if it is unable to secure the undertaking of
such investigations or original research by a qualified public or
private agency, it shall have the power to make its own investigations
and conduct its own research. The commission may make contracts with any
public or private agencies or private persons or entities for the
undertaking of such investigations, or original research within its
purview.

majority of the members are present and vote in favor of such action;
provided that any action not binding for such a reason may be ratified
within 30 days by the concurrence in writing of a majority of the
commission membership. No action of the commission respecting a matter
other than its internal management shall be binding unless taken at a

members representing the United States are present and a majority of
said state members together with a majority of said members representing

States Census of Population, but provided that the total contributions
of all of the states shall not be required to exceed

**New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Compact**


                                             
 *Whereas*, The growth of population and the development of the
territory of the New England states has resulted in serious pollution of
certain interstate streams, ponds and lakes, and of tidal waters ebbing
and flowing past the boundaries of 2 or more states; and
                                             
 *Whereas*, Such pollution constitutes a menace to the health,
welfare and economic prosperity of the people living in such areas; and
                                             
 *Whereas*, The abatement of existing pollution and the control of
future pollution in the interstate waters of the New England area are of
prime importance to the people and can best be accomplished through the
cooperation of the New England states in the establishment of an
interstate agency to work with the states in the field of pollution
abatement;
                                             
 Now, therefore, the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont do agree and are bound as follows:
                                             
 Article I. It is agreed between the signatory states that the
provisions of this compact shall apply to streams, ponds and lakes which
are contiguous to 2 or more signatory states or which flow through 2 or
more signatory states or which have a tributary contiguous to 2 or more
signatory states or flowing through 2 or more signatory states, and also
shall apply to tidal waters ebbing and flowing past the boundaries of 2
states.
                                             
 Article II. There is created the New England Interstate Water
Pollution Control Commission (referred to in this compact as the
commission) which shall be a body corporate and politic having the
powers, duties and jurisdiction enumerated in this compact and such
other and additional powers as shall be conferred upon it by the act or
acts of a signatory state concurred in by the others.
                                             
 Article III. The commission shall consist of 5 commissioners from
each signatory state, each of whom shall be a resident voter of the
state from which he is appointed. The commissioners shall be chosen in
the manner and for the terms provided by law of the state from which
they shall be appointed. For each state there shall be on the commission
a member representing the state health department, a member representing
the state water pollution control board (if such exists), and, except
where a state in its enabling legislation decides that the best
interests of the state will be otherwise served, a member representing
municipal interests, a member representing industrial interests, and a
member representing an agency acting for fisheries or conservation.
                                             
 Article IV. The commission shall annually elect from its members a
chairman and vice chairman and shall appoint and at its pleasure remove
or discharge such officers. It may appoint and employ a secretary who
shall be a professional engineer versed in water pollution and may
employ such stenographic or clerical employees as shall be necessary,
and at its pleasure remove or discharge such employees. It shall adopt a
seal and suitable bylaws and shall adopt rules and regulations for its
management and control. It may maintain an office for the transaction of
its business and may meet at any time or place within the signatory
states. Meetings shall be held at least twice each year. A majority of
the members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business,
but no action of the commission imposing any obligation on any signatory
state or on any municipal agency or subdivision thereof or on any
person, firm or corporation therein shall be binding unless a majority
of the members from such signatory state shall have voted in favor of
such action. Where meetings are planned to discuss matters relevant to
problems of water pollution control affecting only certain of the
signatory states, the commission may vote to authorize special meetings
of the commissioners of the states especially concerned. The commission
shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements and shall
make an annual report to the governor and the legislature of each
signatory state setting forth in detail the operations and transactions
conducted by it pursuant to this compact, and shall make recommendations
for any legislative action deemed by it advisable, including amendments
to the statutes of the signatory states which may be necessary to
implement the intent and purpose of this compact. The commission shall
not incur any obligations for salaries, office, administrative,
traveling or other expenses prior to the allotment of funds by the
signatory states adequate to meet the same, nor shall the commission
pledge the credit of any of the signatory states. Each signatory state
reserves the right to provide hereafter by law for the examination and
audit of the accounts of the commission. The commission shall appoint a
treasurer who may be a member of the commission, and disbursements by
the commission shall be valid only when authorized by the commission and
when vouchers therefor have been signed by the secretary and
countersigned by the treasurer. The secretary shall be custodian of the
records of the commission with authority to attest to and certify such
records or copies of such records.
                                             
 Article V. It is recognized, owing to such variable factors as
location, size, character and flow and the many varied uses of the
waters subject to the terms of this compact, that no single standard of
sewage and waste treatment and no single standard of quality of
receiving waters is practical and that the degree of treatment of sewage
and industrial wastes should take into account the classification of the
receiving waters according to present and proposed highest use, such as
for drinking water supply, industrial and agricultural uses, bathing and
other recreational purposes, maintenance and propagation of fish life,
shellfish culture, navigation and disposal of wastes.
                                             
 The commission shall establish reasonable physical, chemical and
bacteriological standards of water quality satisfactory for various
classifications of use. It is agreed that each of the signatory states
through appropriate agencies will prepare a classification of its
interstate waters in entirety or by portions according to present and
proposed highest use and for this purpose technical experts employed by
state departments of health and state water pollution control agencies
are authorized to confer on questions relating to classification of
interstate waters affecting 2 or more states. Each signatory state
agrees to submit its classification of its interstate waters to the
commission for approval. It is agreed that after such approval, all
signatory states through their appropriate state health departments and
water pollution control agencies will work to establish programs of
treatment of sewage and industrial wastes which will meet standards
established by the commission for classified waters. The commission may
from time to time make such changes in definitions of classifications
and in standards as may be required by changed conditions or as may be
necessary for uniformity.
                                             
 Article VI. Each of the signatory states pledges to provide for the
abatement of existing pollution and for the control of future pollution
of interstate inland and tidal waters as described in Article I, and to
put and maintain the waters thereof in a satisfactory condition
consistent with the highest classified use of each body of water.
                                             
 Article VII. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to repeal or
prevent the enactment of any legislation or prevent the enforcement of
any requirement by any signatory state imposing any additional condition
or restriction to further lessen the pollution of waters within its
jurisdiction. Nothing contained in this compact shall affect or abate
any action now pending brought by any governmental board or body created
by or existing under any of the signatory states.
                                             
 Article VIII. The signatory states agree to appropriate for the
salaries, office, administrative, travel and other expenses such sum or
sums as shall be recommended by the commission. The commonwealth of
Massachusetts obligates itself only to the extent of 
                                             $6,500 in any one
year, the state of Connecticut only to the extent of 
                                             $3,000 in any one
year, the state of Rhode Island only to the extent of 
                                             $1,500 in any one
year, and the states of New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont each only to
the extent of 
                                             $1,000 in any one year.
                                             
 Article IX. Should any part of this compact be held to be contrary
to the constitution of any signatory state or of the United States, all
other parts of the compact shall continue to be in full force and
effect.
                                             
 Article X. The commission is authorized to discuss with appropriate
state agencies in New York state questions of pollution of waters which
flow into the New England area from New York state or vice versa and to
further the establishment of agreements on pollution abatement to
promote the interests of the New York and New England areas. Whenever
the commission by majority vote of the members of each signatory state
shall have given its approval and the state of New York shall have taken
the necessary action to do so, the state of New York shall be a party to
this compact for the purpose of controlling and abating the pollution of
waterways common to New York and the New England states signatory to
this compact, but excluding the waters under the jurisdiction of the
Interstate Sanitation Commission (New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut).
                                             
 Article XI. This compact shall become effective immediately upon the
adoption of the compact by any 2 contiguous states of New England but
only insofar as it applies to those states and upon approval by federal
law. Thereafter upon ratification by other contiguous states, it shall
also become effective as to those states.
