### Section 12-C:1

 **12-C:1 Compact Authorized. â€“** The Maine-New Hampshire Commission
on Oceanography is hereby enacted into law and entered into with the
State of Maine provided the State of Maine legally joins therein in the
form substantially as follows:

**Maine-New Hampshire Commission on Oceanography**

**Article I. Findings**


                                             
 Maine and New Hampshire are by virtue of geographic location and
other characteristics ocean oriented commercially; the population of
both states contributes substantially to the strength and security of
the United States on and under the ocean; one of the largest continental
shelf areas of the United States lies off the shores of Maine and New
Hampshire; the resources of the Gulf of Maine and the ocean can provide
a source of great economic growth; Maine and New Hampshire's
educational, industrial, commercial and scientific interests have been
mutually pursuing ocean oriented activity; and the increased use of
these facilities and resources requires coordination and planning
between the States of Maine and New Hampshire. To this end, it is the
intent of this compact to establish and provide for a bi-state
commission on oceanography and hydrospace.

**Article II. Purpose**


                                             
 It is the purpose of this compact to provide, in the States of Maine
and New Hampshire, improved facilities and procedures for the expansion,
coordination and implementation of the policies, programs, and
activities of interstate significance in the Maine-New Hampshire region
in the field of oceanography and hydrospace including, but not limited
to the physical, social, economic, educational and scientific aspects
related directly or indirectly thereto; to study, investigate and plan
appropriate activities with respect to the coordination, development,
expansion, and implementation of every phase of oceanography and
hydrospace; to provide means by which interstate conflicts may be
resolved; and to provide procedures for interstate coordination of the
interests of all public and private agencies, persons and entities in
the fields covered by this compact and to provide an organization to
carry out the purposes of this compact.

**Article III. Creation of Commission**


                                             
 There is hereby created the Maine-New Hampshire Commission on
Oceanography, hereinafter called the commission.

**Article IV. Membership**


                                             
 The commission shall consist of 6 members from each party state to
be appointed and to serve, in accordance with and subject to the laws of
the state which they represent. The members of the commission shall
consist of persons who are representative of the fields of industry,
education, commerce, and government.

**Article V. Functions**


                                             
 To carry out the purpose of this compact it shall be the
responsibility of the commission to prepare studies and plans, and to
recommend procedures and sponsor programs to implement, coordinate,
develop and expand all activities directly or indirectly related to the
fields of oceanography and hydrospace in all areas of Maine and New
Hampshire or areas that may affect these states; and these activities
may include but are not limited to the following:
                                             
 (1) Collection and interpretation of basic data.
                                             
 (2) Investigation, planning, and programming (including
scheduling) of projects of interstate or regional significance.
                                             
 (3) Planning and scheduling of governmental services and programs
which would be of assistance to the orderly growth and prosperity of the
region, and to the well-being of its population in the fields of
oceanography and hydrospace.
                                             
 (4) Encouraging of the referral of plans or proposals for
projects and programs of interstate or regional significance to the
commission.
                                             
 (5) Studying and recommending means for the most effective
utilization of such federal assistance as may be available on a regional

 (6) Assisting the party states, or either of them, in cooperative

 (7) Assisting and advising industry, governmental agencies and

associated with oceanography or hydrospace.
                                             
 To avoid duplication of effort and in the interests of economy, the
commission shall make use of existing studies, surveys, plans, data, and
other materials in the possession of the governmental agencies of the
party states and their respective subdivisions or in the possession of
other interstate agencies. Each such agency, within available
appropriations and if not expressly prevented or limited by law, is
hereby authorized to make such materials available to the commission and
to otherwise assist it in the performance of its functions. At the
request of the commission each such agency is further authorized to
provide the commission with information regarding plans and programs
affecting the Maine-New Hampshire region so that the commission may have
available to it current information with respect thereto.
                                             
 The commission shall use qualified public and private agencies to
make investigations and conduct research, but if it is unable to secure
the undertaking of such investigations or original research by a
qualified public or private agency, it shall have the power to make its
own investigations and to conduct its own research. The commission may
make contracts with any public or private agencies or private persons or
entities for the undertaking of such investigations or original research
within its purview.

any other government or agency whatever, or private citizens, or
representatives of private organizations, may serve at the request of
the commission upon such advisory committees as the commission may
determine to create; and such officers and personnel of any such
government or agency, may serve upon its committees without forfeiture
of office or employment and with no loss or diminution in the status,
rights and privileges which they otherwise enjoy.

**Article VI. Cooperation With the Federal Government and Other
Governmental Agencies**


                                             
 Each party state is hereby authorized to participate in cooperative
or joint undertakings with the federal government, any appropriate
agency or agencies thereof, or with any interstate agency or agencies.
Such participation shall be at the instance of the governor or in such
other manner as state laws may provide or authorize. The commission
shall facilitate the work of state representatives in any joint
interstate or cooperative federal-state undertaking authorized by this
Article, and each state shall keep the commission advised of its
activities in respect of such undertakings, to the extent that they have
interstate or regional significance.

**Article VII. Meetings and Voting**

requirement may be ratified within 30 days by the concurrence in writing
of a majority of the commission members.
