protector.

 (5) Notice shall be given to each of the interested persons. The

 (8) A settlor's failure to commence a judicial proceeding under

that the trust is invalid for any reason.
                                             
 (e) A trustee may proceed to distribute the trust property in

contesting the validity of the trust has not expired. The trustee is not
subject to liability for doing so unless:

 **564-B:4-413 Cy Pres. –**
                                             
 (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), if a
particular charitable purpose becomes impossible, impracticable,
illegal, obsolete, ineffective or prejudicial to the public interest to
achieve:
                                             
 (1) the trust does not fail, in whole or in part;
                                             
 (2) the trust property does not revert to the settlor or the
settlor's successors in interest; and
                                             
 (3) upon petition by the trustee or trustees, the director of
charitable trusts or an interested party other than the settlor, the
court may apply cy pres to modify or terminate the trust by directing
that the trust property be applied or distributed, in whole or in part,
to a charitable purpose which is useful to the community and which
fulfills as nearly as possible the general charitable intent of the
settlor.
                                             
 (b) A provision in the terms of a charitable trust that would
result in distribution of the trust property to a noncharitable
beneficiary prevails over the power of the court under subsection (a) to
apply cy pres to modify or terminate the trust only if, when the
provision takes effect:
                                             
 (1) the trust property is to revert to the settlor and the
settlor is still living; or
                                             
 (2) fewer than 21 years have elapsed since the date of the
trust's creation.

                                             $100,000 may terminate the trust if the trustee concludes that the
value of the trust property is insufficient to justify the cost of
administration.
                                             
 (b) The court may modify or terminate a trust or remove the

of the trust property is insufficient to justify the cost of
administration.

### Section 564-B:4-418

 **564-B:4-418 Trustee's Power to Decant Trust. –** (a) Subject to
the limitations provided in this section, a trustee has the power to
decant a trust. The power to decant is the power to appoint some or all
of the trust property of a trust ("first trust'') to another trust
("second trust''). A trustee's power to decant is a power with respect
to an administrative matter of the trust.
                                             
 (b) The beneficiaries of the second trust may include only one or
more of the beneficiaries of the first trust. The second trust may
exclude one or more of the beneficiaries of the first trust. A person is
not a beneficiary of the second trust solely by reason of being a
permissible appointee of a power of appointment under the terms of the
second trust.
                                             
 (c) Under the terms of the second trust, a person may have a power
of appointment if (1) that person was a beneficiary of the first trust
or (2) under the terms of the first trust, that person held a power of
appointment either in a fiduciary or nonfiduciary capacity.
                                             
 (d) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the terms of
the second trust may provide that a trustee has discretion to distribute
income or principal, and the terms of the second trust may impose a
standard or no standard on the trustee's discretion regardless of
whether the terms of the first trust imposed a standard on the trustee's
discretion to distribute income or principal. If the first trust is a
charitable trust and the terms of the first trust impose a standard on
the trustee's discretion to distribute income or principal, then the
terms of the second trust shall impose the same standard on the
trustee's discretion to distribute income or principal, unless the
director of charitable trusts expressly consents to the modification or
elimination of that standard.
                                             
 (e) The second trust may have a term that is longer than the first
trust.
                                             
 (f) A trustee may not decant to the extent that the terms of the
second trust are inconsistent with a material purpose of the first
trust.
                                             
 (g)(1) A trustee may not decant to the extent that the terms of the
second trust reduce or eliminate a vested interest of a beneficiary of
the first trust.
                                             
 (2) A vested interest is:
                                             
 (A) a current right to a mandatory distribution of income or
principal, a mandatory annuity interest, or a mandatory unitrust
interest;
                                             
 (B) a currently-exercisable power of withdrawal; or
                                             
 (C) a noncontingent, unconditional right to receive an
ascertainable portion of the trust property upon the trust's
termination.
                                             
 (3) In addition to other possible contingencies, a beneficiary's
right to receive a portion of the trust property upon the trust's
termination is contingent if, by reason of the trustee's discretionary
power to make distributions or under other terms of the trust, any
person other than the beneficiary or the beneficiary's estate could
receive that portion unless the beneficiary survives a specified date or
a specified event.
                                             
 (h) If a transfer to the first trust qualified for a deduction,
credit, exclusion, or exemption for purposes of any income, gift,
estate, or generation-skipping transfer tax, then a trustee may decant
only to the extent that the decanting would not jeopardize that
deduction, credit, exclusion, or exemption.
                                             
 (i) If a settlor of the first trust or a beneficiary of the first
trust is an applicant for public benefits or receives public benefits
and the settlor's or beneficiary's eligibility or qualification for
those public benefits is dependent on the nature and scope of his or her
rights, powers, and interests in the first trust, then a trustee may
decant only to the extent that the decanting would not jeopardize the
settlor's or beneficiary's eligibility or qualification for those public
benefits.
                                             
 (j) A trustee may not decant to the extent that, under the terms of
the second trust:
                                             
 (1) one or more beneficiaries can remove the trustee;
                                             
 (2) those beneficiaries can appoint a successor trustee who, with
respect to any of them, is a related or subordinate party within the
meaning of section 672(c) of the Internal Revenue Code;
                                             
 (3) the trustee may distribute trust property to any one or more
of those beneficiaries; and
                                             
 (4) the trustee's discretion to make those distributions is not
limited by an ascertainable standard.
                                             
 (k) A trustee who is a beneficiary of the first trust does not have
the power to decant to the extent that, under the terms of the first
trust:
                                             
 (1) the trustee does not have the discretion to make or
participate in making distributions to himself or herself unless the
terms of second trust impose the same limitation on that trustee's
discretion;
                                             
 (2) the trustee's discretion to make or participate in making
distributions to himself or herself is limited by an ascertainable
standard unless the terms of second trust impose the same limitation on
that trustee's discretion;
                                             
 (3) the trustee's discretion to make or participate in making
distributions to himself or herself is exercisable only with the consent
of a cotrustee or a person holding an adverse interest, unless the terms
of second trust impose the same limitation on that trustee's discretion;
or
                                             
 (4) the trustee does not have the discretion to make or
participate in making distributions in a manner that will discharge his
or her legal support obligations, unless the terms of second trust
impose the same limitation on that trustee's discretion.
                                             
 (l) A trustee is not prohibited from decanting solely because:
                                             
 (1) the first trust is irrevocable;
                                             
 (2) the terms of the first trust provide that the trust may not
be amended or modified;
                                             
 (3) the first trust contains a spendthrift provision;
                                             
 (4) under the terms of the first trust, the trustee does not have
any discretion in making distributions of income or principal; or
                                             
 (5) except as provided in subsection (d), the terms of the first
trust impose a standard on the trustee's discretion to distribute income
or principal.
                                             
 (m) A trustee of a charitable trust or a trust in which a charitable
organization has a vested interest shall notify the director of
charitable trusts of a proposed decanting, and the trustee shall provide
that notice in writing at least 30 days before the effective date of the
decanting. A trustee of a noncharitable trust may notify a beneficiary
of a proposed decanting, but does not have any duty to do so. The right
of any beneficiary to object to a proposed decanting terminates if the
beneficiary does not notify the trustee of an objection within 60 days
after the proposal was sent to the beneficiary but only if the proposal
informed the beneficiary of the right to object and the time allowed for
objection.
                                             
 (n) A trustee's power to decant may be expanded, restricted,
eliminated, or otherwise altered by the terms of the trust. A
nonjudicial settlement agreement made in accordance with RSA
564-B:1-111, however, may only restrict or eliminate a trustee's power
to decant. Except as otherwise provided under the terms of the trust, a
trustee's power to decant is in addition to any other powers conferred
by the terms of the trust, this chapter, or the laws of this state. This
section does not expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise alter any
power that, with respect to a trust, a person holds in a nonfiduciary
capacity.
                                             
 (o) A trustee does not have a duty to decant or an ongoing duty to
consider whether to decant. In exercising the power to decant, a trustee
has a duty to exercise the power in a manner that is consistent with the
settlor's intent as expressed in the terms of the trust, and the trustee
shall act in accordance with the trustee's duties under this chapter and
the terms of the first trust.
                                             
 (p) A trustee may exercise the power to decant, without court
approval, the consent of the settlor, or the consent of any of the
beneficiaries of the first trust. A trustee or any other interested
person may ask a court to approve a trustee's exercise of the power to
decant.

 **564-B:4-419 Trustee's Power of Modification. –** (a) Subject to
the limitations provided in this section, a trustee may modify a trust.
A trustee may exercise that power of modification for any reason,
including:
                                             
 (1) furthering the settlor's intent or a material purpose of the
trust;
                                             
 (2) preserving any favorable tax treatment for the trust, the
settlor, or the beneficiaries;
                                             
 (3) enhancing the efficient administration of the trust; or
                                             
 (4) minimizing the costs of administration.
                                             
 (b) A trustee's power under this section is a power with respect to
an administrative matter of the trust.
                                             
 (c) A trustee shall not modify a trust to that extent that:
                                             
 (1) the terms of the trust expressly prohibit the trustee's
modification of the trust;
                                             
 (2) the modification is inconsistent with the settlor's intent or
a material purpose of the trust;
                                             
 (3) the modification expands, restricts, eliminates, or otherwise
alters any right or power that the settlor has under this chapter or the
terms of the trust;
                                             
 (4) the modification adds a beneficiary, unless the modification
is expressly permitted under the terms of the trust;
                                             
 (5) the modification reduces or eliminates a beneficiary's vested
interest in the trust;
                                             
 (6) the modification reduces or eliminates a beneficiary's
interest in the trust (other than a vested interest), unless the
modification is consistent with the settlor's intent as clearly
expressed under the terms of the trust;
                                             
 (7) the modification adds a power of withdrawal or a power of
appointment, unless the modification is consistent with the settlor's
intent as clearly expressed under the terms of the trust;
                                             
 (8) the modification reduces or eliminates a
currently-exercisable power of appointment held by any person other than
a beneficiary, unless the modification is consistent with the settlor's
intent as clearly expressed under the terms of the trust; or
                                             
 (9) the modification modifies any of the dispositive terms of a
charitable trust, unless the director of charitable trusts consents to
the modification.
                                             
 (d) If the trust or a transfer to the trust qualified for a
deduction, credit, exclusion, or exemption for purposes of any income,
gift, estate, or other tax, then a trustee may modify a trust only to
that extent that the modification would not jeopardize that deduction,
credit, exclusion, or exemption.
                                             
 (e) If a settlor of the trust or a beneficiary of the trust is an
applicant for public benefits or receives public benefits and the
settlor's or beneficiary's eligibility or qualification for those public
benefits is dependent on the nature and scope of his or her rights,
powers, and interests in the trust, then a trustee may modify the trust
only to the extent that the modification would not jeopardize the
settlor's or beneficiary's eligibility or qualification for those public
benefits.
                                             
 (f) A trustee does not have the power of modification under this
section if the trustee is any of the following persons, either before or
after the modification: (1) the settlor; (2) a beneficiary of the trust;
(3) a person who, with respect to the settlor or a beneficiary of the
trust, is a related or subordinate party within the meaning of section
672(c) of the Internal Revenue Code; or (4) a trustee whom any one or
more of the settlor and the beneficiaries can remove if the persons
exercising the removal power can appoint as a successor trustee (i) the
settlor, (ii) a beneficiary of the trust, or (iii) a person who, with
respect to the settlor or a beneficiary of the trust, is a related or
subordinate party within the meaning of section 672(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code.
                                             
 (g) A trustee is not prohibited from exercising the power of
modification, and the exercise of that power is not inconsistent with
the settlor's intent, solely because:
                                             
 (1) the trust is irrevocable;
                                             
 (2) the terms of the trust provide that the trust may not be
amended by the settlor; or
                                             
 (3) the trust contains a spendthrift provision.
                                             
 (h) A trustee of a charitable trust or a trust in which a charitable
organization has a vested interest shall notify the director of
charitable trusts of a proposed modification under this section, and the
trustee shall provide that notice in writing at least 30 days before the
effective date of that modification. A trustee of a noncharitable trust
may notify a beneficiary of a proposed modification under this section,
but does not have any duty to do so. The right of any beneficiary to
object to a proposed modification terminates if the beneficiary does not
notify the trustee of an objection within 60 days after the proposal was
sent to the beneficiary but only if the proposal informed the
beneficiary of the right to object and the time allowed for objection.
                                             
 (i) A trustee's power of modification under this section may be
expanded, restricted, eliminated, or otherwise altered by the terms of
the trust. A nonjudicial settlement agreement made in accordance with
RSA 564-B:1-111, however, may only restrict or eliminate a trustee's
power of modification under this section. Except as otherwise provided
under the terms of the trust, a trustee's power of modification under
this section is in addition to any other powers conferred by the terms
of the trust, this chapter, or the laws of this state. This section does
not expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise alter any power that, with
respect to a trust, a person holds in a nonfiduciary capacity.
                                             
 (j) A trustee does not have a duty to modify a trust or an ongoing
duty to consider whether to modify a trust. In exercising the power of
modification under this section, a trustee has a duty to exercise the
power in a manner that is consistent with the settlor's intent as
expressed in the terms of the trust, and the trustee shall act in
accordance with the trustee's duties under this chapter and the terms of
the trust.
                                             
 (k) A trustee may exercise the power of modification under this
section without court approval, the consent of the settlor, or the
consent of any of the beneficiaries of the trust. A trustee or any other
interested person may ask a court to approve a trustee's exercise of the
power of modification.
                                             
 (l) For purposes of this section, "vested interest'' means a vested
interest as defined in RSA 564-B:4-418(g).

 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), whether or
not a trust contains a spendthrift provision, a creditor of a

 (1) the discretion is expressed in the form of a standard of

 (2) the court shall direct the trustee to pay to the child,
spouse, or former spouse such amount as is equitable under the
circumstances but not more than the amount the trustee would have been
required to distribute to or for the benefit of the beneficiary had the
trustee complied with the standard or not abused the discretion and with
respect to alimony, only for and to the extent that the judgment or
court order expressly specifies the alimony amount attributable to the
most basic food, shelter, and medical needs of the spouse or former
spouse.

 (e) A creditor or assignee of a beneficiary may not compel a
distribution to the beneficiary solely because the beneficiary is a
trustee if the beneficiary-trustee does not have the discretion to make
or participate in making distributions to himself or herself, if the
beneficiary-trustee's discretion to make or participate in making
distributions to himself or herself is limited by an ascertainable
standard, or if the beneficiary-trustee's discretion to make or
participate in making distributions to himself or herself is exercisable
only with the consent of a cotrustee or another person holding an
adverse interest. Under such circumstances, the creditor or assignee may

otherwise may compel a distribution were the beneficiary not acting as
trustee or cotrustee.

rules apply:
                                             
 (1) During the lifetime of the settlor, the property of a
revocable trust is subject to claims of the settlor's creditors.
                                             
 (2) With respect to an irrevocable trust, a creditor or assignee
of the settlor may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to
or for the settlor's benefit. If a trust has more than one settlor, the
amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach may
not exceed the settlor's interest in the portion of the trust
attributable to that settlor's contribution. This subparagraph shall not
apply to:
                                             
 (A) a charitable remainder annuity trust within the meaning of
section 664(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code;

Revenue Code;
                                             
 (D) a trust described in section 2523(f) of the Internal
Revenue Code;
                                             
 (E) an irrevocable "special needs trust'' established for a
disabled person as described in 42 U.S.C. 1396p(d)(4) or similar federal
law governing the transfer to such a trust; or
                                             
 (F) an irrevocable trust solely because of the existence or
exercise of a discretionary power granted to the trustee by the terms of
the trust, court order, nonjudicial settlement agreement, or any other
provision of law (or the existence or exercise of a discretionary power
granted to a trust advisor or trust protector by the terms of the trust,
court order, nonjudicial settlement agreement, or any other provision of
law, to direct the trustee) to pay directly to the taxing authorities or
to reimburse the settlor for any tax on trust income or principal which
is payable by the settlor under the law imposing such tax.
                                             
 (3) After the death of a settlor, and subject to the settlor's
right to direct the source from which liabilities will be paid, the
property of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death is subject
to claims of the settlor's creditors, costs of administration of the
settlor's estate, the expenses of the settlor's funeral and disposal of
remains to the extent the settlor's probate estate is inadequate to
satisfy those claims, costs, and expenses. This section does not apply
to the proceeds and any other benefits of a policy of life or endowment
insurance effected by the settlor on the settlor's own life or on
another life as provided in RSA 408:2.
                                             
 (4) To the extent a claim against a settlor is barred under RSA
564-B:5-508, this section shall not apply to that claim.
                                             
 (b) During only the period that the power may be exercised, the
holder of a power of withdrawal is treated in the same manner under this
section as the settlor of a revocable trust to the extent of the
property subject to the power.
                                             
 (c) Nothing in this section shall limit the application of the
Qualified Dispositions in Trust Act set forth in RSA 564-D.

distribution of income or principal that the trustee is required to make
to a beneficiary under the terms of the trust, including a distribution
upon termination of the trust. The term excludes a distribution subject
to the exercise of the trustee's discretion regardless of whether the

trustee in making distribution decisions or (ii) provide that the
trustee "may'' or "shall'' make discretionary distributions, including

 (4) there has been a substantial change of circumstances or
removal is requested by all of the qualified beneficiaries, the court
finds that removal of the trustee best serves the interests of all of

reorganization of a corporate trustee, does not require the notice
described in subsection (c)(2) of this section.

 (j) If the trustee is bound by any written confidentiality
restrictions with respect to an asset of a trust, a trustee may require
that any beneficiary who is eligible to receive information pursuant to
this section about such asset shall agree in writing to be bound by the
confidentiality restrictions that bind the trustee before receiving such
information from the trustee.

designated by the terms of the trust shall keep each excluded fiduciary
designated by the terms of the trust reasonably informed about (1) the
administration of the trust with respect to any specific duty or
function being performed by the trust advisor, trust protector, or other
fiduciary to the extent that the duty or function would normally be
performed by the excluded fiduciary or to the extent that providing such
information to the excluded fiduciary is reasonably necessary for the
excluded fiduciary to perform its duties and (2) any other material
information that the excluded fiduciary would be required to disclose to
the qualified beneficiaries under subsection (b) regardless of whether
the terms of the trust relieve the excluded fiduciary from providing
such information to qualified beneficiaries. Neither the performance nor
the failure to perform of a trust advisor, trust protector, or other
fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust as provided in this
subsection shall affect the limitation on the liability of the excluded
fiduciary provided by RSA 564-B:12-1206 and RSA 564-B:12-1207.

 (c) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a), unless the terms
of the trust expressly provide otherwise, if the terms of a trust permit
distributions among a class of beneficiaries, distributions to or for
the benefit of whom are subject to the exercise of the trustee's
discretion without a standard to guide the trustee in making
distribution decisions, then the trustee may make distributions
unequally among the beneficiaries and may make distributions entirely to
one beneficiary to the exclusion of the other beneficiaries.

 (1) a person other than a settlor who is a beneficiary and
trustee of a trust that confers on the trustee a power to make
discretionary distributions to or for the trustee's personal benefit may
exercise the power only in accordance with an ascertainable standard;
and
                                             
 (2) a trustee may not exercise a power to make discretionary

personally owes another person.
                                             
 (e) A power whose exercise is limited or prohibited by paragraph
(d) may be exercised by a majority of the remaining trustees whose
exercise of the power is not so limited or prohibited. If the power of
all trustees is so limited or prohibited, the court may appoint a
special trustee with authority to exercise the power.
                                             
 (f) Paragraph (d) does not apply to:
                                             
 (1) a power held by the settlor's spouse who is the trustee of
a trust for which a marital deduction was previously allowed under
section 2056(b)(5) or 2523(e) of the Internal Revenue Code;

 (a) Instead of furnishing a copy of the trust instrument to a
person other than a beneficiary, the trustee may furnish to the person a
certification of trust containing the following information:
                                             
 (1) that the trust exists and the date the trust instrument
was executed;
                                             
 (2) the identity of the settlor;
                                             
 (3) the identity and address of the currently acting trustee;
                                             
 (4) the powers of the trustee;
                                             
 (5) the revocability or irrevocability of the trust and the
identity of any person holding a power to revoke the trust;
                                             
 (6) the authority of cotrustees to sign or otherwise
authenticate and whether all or less than all are required in order to
exercise powers of the trustee;
                                             
 (7) the trust's taxpayer identification number; and
                                             
 (8) the manner of taking title to trust property.
                                             
 (b) A certification of trust may be signed or otherwise
authenticated by any trustee.
                                             
 (c) A certification of trust must state that the trust has not
been revoked, modified, or amended in any manner that would cause the
representations contained in the certification of trust to be
incorrect.
                                             
 (d) A certification of trust need not contain the dispositive
terms of a trust.
                                             
 (e) A recipient of a certification of trust may require the
trustee to furnish copies of those excerpts from the original trust
instrument and later amendments which designate the trustee and confer
upon the trustee the power to act in the pending transaction.
                                             
 (f) A person who acts in reliance upon a certification of trust
without knowledge that the representations contained therein are
incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting and may assume
without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the
certification. Knowledge of the terms of the trust may not be inferred
solely from the fact that a copy of all or part of the trust instrument
is held by the person relying upon the certification.
                                             
 (g) A person who in good faith enters into a transaction in
reliance upon a certification of trust may enforce the transaction
against the trust property as if the representations contained in the
certification were correct.
                                             
 (h) A person making a demand for the trust instrument in addition
to a certification of trust or excerpts is liable for damages if the
court determines that the person did not act in good faith in demanding
the trust instrument.
                                             
 (i) This section does not limit the right of a person to obtain a
copy of the trust instrument in a judicial proceeding concerning the
trust.
                                             
 (j) Instead of the certification of trust described in subsection
(a), a certificate described in RSA 564-A:7 shall protect persons
dealing with a trustee in connection with the conveyance of real or
personal property as provided in RSA 564-A:7. Nothing in this section is
intended to expand, limit, or otherwise affect the provisions of RSA
564-A:7.

### Section 564-B:10-1014

 **564-B:10-1014 Enforcement of No-Contest Provision. –** (a) For the
purposes of this section, a "no-contest provision'' of a trust
instrument means a provision that, if given effect, would reduce or
eliminate the interest of any beneficiary of such trust who, directly or
indirectly, initiates or otherwise pursues:
                                             
 (1) Any action to contest the validity of the trust or the terms
of the trust;
                                             
 (2) Any action to set aside or vary the terms of the trust;
                                             
 (3) Any action to challenge the acts of the trustee or other
fiduciary of the trust in the performance of the trustee's or other
fiduciary's duties as described in the terms of the trust; or
                                             
 (4) Any other act or proceedings to frustrate or defeat the
settlor's intent as expressed in the terms of the trust.
                                             
 (b) A no-contest provision shall be enforceable according to the
express terms of the no-contest provision without regard to the presence
or absence of probable cause for, or the beneficiary's good or bad faith
in, taking the action that would justify the complete or partial
forfeiture of the beneficiary's interest in the trust under the terms of
the no-contest provision. A no-contest provision shall be unenforceable
to the extent that the trust is invalid because of fraud, duress, undue
influence, lack of testamentary capacity, or any other reason. In the
case of an action solely to challenge the acts of the trustee or other
fiduciary of the trust, a no-contest provision shall be unenforceable to
the extent that the trustee or other fiduciary has committed a breach of
fiduciary duties or breach of trust.
                                             
 (c) Subsection (b) shall not apply to the extent that a person
initiates, maintains, or cooperates in any of the following actions or
proceedings:
                                             
 (1) Any action brought by the trustee or any other fiduciary
serving under the terms of the trust, unless the trustee or other
fiduciary is a beneficiary against whom the no-contest provision is
otherwise enforceable;
                                             
 (2) Any agreement among the beneficiaries and any other
interested persons in settlement of a dispute or resolution of any other
matter relating to the trust, including without limitation any
nonjudicial settlement agreement;
                                             
 (3) Any action to determine whether a proposed or pending motion,
petition, or other proceeding constitutes a contest within the meaning
of a no-contest provision;
                                             
 (4) Any action brought by a beneficiary or on behalf of any such
beneficiary for a construction or interpretation of the terms of the
trust;
                                             
 (5) Any action brought by the attorney general for a construction
or interpretation of a charitable trust or a trust containing a
charitable interest if a provision exists in a trust purporting to
penalize a charity or charitable interest for contesting the trust if
probable cause exists for instituting proceedings; or
                                             
 (6) A proceeding described in subsection (h).
                                             
 (d) It is the intent of this section to enforce the settlor's intent
as reflected in a no-contest provision to the greatest extent possible.
The provisions of this section shall be construed and applied in a
manner consistent with such intent.
                                             
 (e) This section shall apply to all judicial proceedings concerning
the enforcement or interpretation of a no-contest provision commenced on
or after its effective date.
                                             
 (f) In the trustee's discretion, a trustee may suspend distributions
to a beneficiary to the extent that, under a no-contest provision, the
beneficiary's action potentially would have caused the reduction or
elimination of the beneficiary's interest in the trust. In the trustee's
discretion, the trustee may resume those distributions at any time or
may continue to suspend those distributions until a court determines
whether the beneficiary's interest in the trust has been reduced or
eliminated.
                                             
 (g) In the trustee's discretion, a trustee may decline to distribute
trust property in accordance with a person's purported exercise of a
power of appointment or a power of withdrawal to the extent that, under
a no-contest provision, the person's action potentially would have
caused the reduction or elimination of the power of appointment or the
power of withdrawal. In the trustee's discretion, the trustee may make
those distributions at any time or may continue to decline to make those
distributions until a court determines whether the person's power of
appointment or power of withdrawal has been reduced or eliminated.
                                             
 (h) To the extent that the trustee acts in good faith, the trustee
is not liable to any person for exercising the discretion under
subsection (f) or (g) or not exercising that discretion. A trustee shall
be presumed to have exercised the discretion in good faith if, in any
judicial proceeding, an interested person other than the trustee has
requested a determination of whether, under the no-contest provision, a
beneficiary's interest in the trust, a person's power of appointment, or
a person's power of withdrawal was reduced or eliminated. A trustee or
any other interested person may commence a judicial proceeding for
purposes of determining whether a trustee's exercise of discretion under
subsection (f) or (g) was made in good faith.

### Section 564-B:10-1015

 **564-B:10-1015 Beneficiary's Disclaimer of an Interest in a Trust.
–** (a) In addition to a beneficiary's right to disclaim an interest in
a trust under RSA 563-B and any other method for refusing to accept an
interest in a trust, a beneficiary may disclaim an interest in a trust,
including a trust that contains a spendthrift provision. An interest may
be less than the beneficiary's entire interest in the trust. The
disclaimer must be made by a written instrument delivered to a trustee.
                                             
 (b) Unless the trustee has made a distribution to or for the benefit
of the beneficiary, a disclaimer under subsection (a) is effective as of
the interest's creation and is not a transfer, assignment, or release of
the disclaimed interest.
                                             
 (c) A beneficiary's right to disclaim an interest in a trust does
not affect the validity or effect of a spendthrift provision.

### Section 564-B:12-1206

 **564-B:12-1206 Limitation of Action Against a Trust Advisor or
Trust Protector. –** (a) A beneficiary shall commence a proceeding
against a trust advisor or trust protector for breach of trust within
the earlier of:
                                             
 (1) One year after the date on which the beneficiary or the
beneficiary's representative was sent a report that adequately disclosed
the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust and informed the
beneficiary of the time allowed for commencing a proceeding;
                                             
 (2) Three years after the date on which the beneficiary or the
beneficiary's representative was sent a report that adequately disclosed
the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust;
                                             
 (3) Three years after the trust advisor's or trust protector's
resignation or removal;
                                             
 (4) To the extent that the claim is not barred by a limitation
period under RSA 556, RSA 564-B:5-508, or other applicable law, three
years after the trust advisor's or trust protector's death;
                                             
 (5) Three years after termination of the beneficiary's interest
in the trust; or
                                             
 (6) Three years after the termination of the trust.
                                             
 (b) A fiduciary shall commence a proceeding against a trust advisor
or trust protector for breach of trust within 3 years after the date on
which the fiduciary was sent a report that adequately disclosed the
existence of a potential claim for breach of trust; provided, however,
that a fiduciary shall not commence a proceeding against a trust advisor
or trust protector for breach of trust if, under subsection (a), none of
the beneficiaries may commence a proceeding against the trust advisor or
trust protector for such breach of trust. For purposes of this section,
a "fiduciary'' means any trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector.
                                             
 (c) A report adequately discloses the existence of a potential claim
for breach of trust if it provides sufficient information so that the
recipient knows of the potential claim or should have inquired into its
existence.
                                             
 (d) The periods of limitation under subsection (a) shall not be
tolled for any reason, except by a written agreement of the qualified
beneficiaries and each of the trust advisors and trust protectors
against whom a beneficiary may commence a proceeding or a court order.
The periods of limitation under subsection (b) shall not be tolled for
any reason, except by a written agreement of the trustees and each of
the trust advisors and trust protectors against whom a fiduciary may
commence a proceeding or a court order. Without limiting the
circumstances under which a court may issue an order tolling the period
of limitations, a court may issue an order tolling the period of
limitations under this section during the pendency of any action
described in RSA 564-B:10-1014(c)(3).
                                             
 (e) 
                                             [Repealed.
