 I. A will shall be valid as regards form, irrespective particularly
of the place where it is made, of the location of the assets and of the
nationality, domicile, or residence of the testator, if it is made in
the form of an international will complying with the requirements of

 II. The invalidity of the will as an international will shall not
affect its formal validity as a will of another kind.

### Section 551-A:3

 **551-A:3 International Will; Requirements. –**
                                             
 I. The will shall be made in writing. It need not be written by a
testator. It may be written in any language, by hand or by any other
means.
                                             
 II. The testator shall declare in the presence of 2 witnesses and of
a person authorized to act in connection with international wills that
the document is the testator's will and that the testator knows the
contents thereof. The testator need not inform the witnesses, or the
authorized person, of the contents of the will.
                                             
 III. In the presence of the witnesses, and of the authorized person,
the testator shall sign the will or, if the testator has previously
signed it, shall acknowledge his or her signature.
                                             
 IV. When the testator is unable to sign, the absence of his or her
signature does not affect the validity of the international will if the
testator indicates the reason for his or her inability to sign and the
authorized person makes note thereof on the will. In these cases, it is
permissible for any other person present, including the authorized
person or one of the witnesses, at the direction of the testator to sign
the testator's name for the testator, if the authorized person makes
note of this also on the will, but it is not required that any person
sign the testator's name.
                                             
 V. The witnesses and the authorized person shall there and then
attest the will by signing in the presence of the testator.

 I. The signatures shall be placed at the end of the will. If the
will consists of several sheets, each sheet will be signed by the
testator or, if he or she is unable to sign, by the person signing on
his or her behalf or, if there is no such person, by the authorized
person. In addition, each sheet shall be numbered.
                                             
 II. The date of the will shall be the date of its signature by the
authorized person. That date shall be noted at the end of the will by
the authorized person.
                                             
 III. The authorized person shall ask the testator whether he or she
wishes to make a declaration concerning the safekeeping of the
testator's will. If so and at the express request of the testator the
place where he or she intends to have his or her will kept shall be
mentioned in the certificate provided for in RSA 551-A:5.
                                             
 IV. A will executed in compliance with RSA 551-A:3 shall not be
invalid merely because it does not comply with this section.
