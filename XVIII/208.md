### Section 208:1-a

 **208:1-a Moose. –**
                                             
 I. No person shall hunt, take, or possess any moose or any part of
the carcass of a moose taken in this state without first obtaining a
valid license for such activities from the department of fish and game.
The executive director of fish and game, with the consent of the
commission, may establish, by rules adopted under RSA 541-A, a hunting
season for moose in any county of the state, or any portion thereof.
Such rules shall include, but not be limited to, the mode by which moose
may be taken; the length of the season; requirements for reporting by
hunters; sex limitations; and total take in any one year. The rules
shall require that no moose shall be taken with rimfire firearms or with
shotguns using shot loads including buckshot, and that in towns
restricting weapon types for deer pursuant to RSA 207:3-b, 208:3,
208:3-a, 208:3-b, and 208:3-c, only weapon types allowed for deer shall
be permitted for the taking of moose.
                                             
 II. The executive director, with the consent of the commission,
shall also adopt rules under RSA 541-A to regulate the issuance of
licenses or permits, including the establishment of a lottery for
awarding of permits to applicants, and to set fees for applications,
licenses, or permits for both resident and nonresident applicants,
provided the fee for nonresident permits shall be at least 
                                             $450.
                                             
 II-a. Any permit lottery established under paragraph II shall
include a bonus point system as a weighing factor to benefit applicants
not drawn in the annual moose permit lottery. Beginning with the 2004
lottery, the moose permit lottery shall allow a person to accumulate one
point for each consecutive year that person legally purchases an
application for a permit but is not selected to receive a permit. Each
point entitles that applicant to one chance in the lottery. A person's
accumulated points shall be non-transferable and shall be forfeited if,
in any year, that person is selected to receive a permit or that person
fails to purchase a new chance.

### Section 208:6-a

 **208:6-a Special Hunting Areas for Certain Disabled Persons. –**
Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 208:2, relating to the taking of
deer upon islands, the executive director may designate in accordance
with this section one or more islands and other designated areas, other
than islands, upon which deer may be taken by paraplegics, persons
suffering from the loss of, or use of, both lower extremities or persons
confined to wheelchairs. An eligible person desiring to take advantage
of the privilege afforded by this section, may, if properly licensed
under the provisions of this title to take deer, apply to the executive
director, at least 15 days before the beginning of the open season for
deer, as prescribed in RSA 208:2, requesting authorization to hunt upon
islands or other designated areas which the executive director in the
executive director's discretion has determined to have an overpopulation
of deer for the vegetation available upon the island or area. In
granting these special licenses under this section, the executive
director should bear in mind the physical limitations of those eligible
under this section to hunt, and the relative difficulty such persons
would have in gaining access to the area designated. Additionally, the
executive director should consider the number of applications, and in
the executive director's discretion limit the number of special licenses
issued for any designated area, to prevent reduction of deer below
desirable limits. Licenses issued under the provisions of this section

and history of the state and is recognized as a valuable game and
wildlife resource. It is recognized that bears should be accorded such
protection as is necessary to maintain and enhance their numbers.
                                             
 II. No person shall take wild black bears in this state without
first procuring a bear license and tag in addition to the applicable
license to hunt issued pursuant to RSA 214 or RSA 208:5. The cost of the
bear license and tag, for both residents and nonresidents, shall be set
by the executive director pursuant to RSA 206:10, I.

attach to the bear's ear the bear tag bearing the name and address of
the licensee and other information that the executive director
determines to be appropriate. The bear tag shall remain attached to the
bear as long as the bear carcass remains in the state. Only the bear tag
issued to the licensee who killed the bear shall be attached to that
bear. No person shall possess a bear tag that was not issued to that
person. No person shall attach a bear tag to a bear the person did not
kill.

of the person who took the animal. The entire game animal shall be
surrendered to the department and repossessed. After surrender and
condemnation of the game animal the licensee shall be given written
