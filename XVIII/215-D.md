INTERSTATE WILDLIFE VIOLATORS COMPACT
-------------------------------------

### Section 215-D:1

 **215-D:1 Interstate Wildlife Violators Compact. â€“** The interstate
wildlife violators compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into
by the State of New Hampshire with any and all states legally joining
therein in accordance with its terms. The compact is substantially as
follows:

ARTICLE I Findings, Declaration of Policy and Purpose


                                             
 (a) The party states find that:
                                             
 (1) Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective
states for the benefit of all residents and visitors.
                                             
 (2) The protection of their respective wildlife resources can
be materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute or
rule relating to the management of those resources.
                                             
 (3) The preservation, protection, management, and restoration
of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and
economic aspects of these natural resources.
                                             
 (4) Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to
political boundaries; therefore, all persons should be required to
comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and
restoration statutes, rules, and other law of all party states as a
condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to
hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife.
                                             
 (5) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management
of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and
property.
                                             
 (6) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates
the maintenance of channels of communications among the various states.
                                             
 (7) A person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state
other than the person's home state:
                                             
 (A) may be required to post collateral or bond to secure
appearance for a trial at a later date;
                                             
 (B) if unable to post collateral or bond, may be taken into
custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or
                                             
 (C) may be taken directly to court for an immediate
appearance.
                                             
 (8) The purpose of the enforcement practices described in
subparagraph (7) of this paragraph is to ensure compliance with the
terms of a wildlife citation by the person who, if permitted to continue
on the person's way after receiving the citation, could return to the
person's home state and disregard the person's duty under the terms of
the citation.
                                             
 (9) A person receiving a wildlife citation in the person's
home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the
scene of the violation and to continue immediately on the person's way
after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the
citation.
                                             
 (10) The practice described in subparagraph (7) of this
paragraph causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for
the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond,
stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody
until some alternative arrangement can be made.
                                             
 (11) The enforcement practices described in subparagraph (7)
of this paragraph consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.
                                             
 (b) It is the policy of the party states to:
                                             
 (1) Promote compliance with the statutes, rules, and other
applicable law relating to management of wildlife resources in their
respective states.
                                             
 (2) Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges or
rights of any person whose license privileges or rights have been
suspended by a party state and treat this suspension as if it had
occurred in the person's state.
                                             
 (3) Allow violators to accept a wildlife citation, except as
provided in paragraph (b) of article III of this compact, and be
released without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the
state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator's
home state is party to this compact.
                                             
 (4) Report to the appropriate party state any conviction that
would subject a person to suspension and that is recorded against any
person whose home state was not the issuing state.
                                             
 (5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat a conviction
that would subject a person to suspension and that is recorded for their
residents and which occurred in another party state as if the conviction
had occurred in the home state.
                                             
 (6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party
states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation
issued in one party state to a resident of another party state.
                                             
 (7) Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and
information.
                                             
 (8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of
wildlife violations.
                                             
 (c) The purpose of this compact is to:
                                             
 (1) Provide a means through which the party states may
participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in
paragraph (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner.
                                             
 (2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife
violators operating within party states in recognition of the person's
right of due process and the sovereign status of a party state.

 (a) When issuing a citation for a wildlife violation, a wildlife
officer shall issue a citation to any person whose primary residence is
in a party state in the same manner as if the person were a resident of
the home state and shall not require the person to post collateral to
secure appearance, subject to the exceptions contained in paragraph (b)
of this article, if the officer receives the person's personal
recognizance that the person will comply with the terms of the
citation.

terms of a citation from the licensing authority of the issuing state,
the licensing authority of the home state shall notify the violator,

privileges or rights until satisfactory evidence of compliance with the

Hampshire.
                                             
 (b) No person whose license, privilege, or right to hunt, fish,
trap, possess, or transport wildlife, having been suspended or revoked
pursuant to this chapter, shall be issued a license to hunt, fish, or
trap in New Hampshire.
                                             
 (c)(1) Prior to suspending a New Hampshire hunting, fishing, or
trapping license of a person under paragraph (a) of this section, the
executive director shall notify the person in writing. A suspension
shall be deemed effective:
                                             
 (I) When given if notice is made in person; or
                                             
 (II) Three days after the deposit of notice in the United
States mails, if notice is made in writing.
                                             
 (2) A person receiving notice under paragraph (a) of this
section may, within 30 days of the date notice is given, request a
hearing before the executive director on whether the requirements for
suspension or penalty have been met. The requesting person may present
evidence and arguments at the hearing only regarding whether:
                                             
 (I) A participating state suspended the person's
privileges;
                                             
 (II) There was a conviction in the participating state;
                                             
 (III) The person failed to comply with the terms of a
citation issued for a wildlife violation in a participating state; or
                                             
 (IV) A conviction in a participating state could have led
to a license suspension or penalty in New Hampshire.
                                             
 (3) At the hearing, the executive director or a hearing
officer designated by the executive director may:
                                             
 (I) Administer oaths;
                                             
 (II) Issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses; and
                                             
 (III) Admit all relevant evidence and documents, including
notifications from participating states.
                                             
 (4) Following a hearing under this paragraph, the executive
director or a designated hearing officer may, based on the evidence,
affirm, modify, or rescind the suspension of a license or the assessment
of a penalty.
                                             
 (5) A suspension of a license under this chapter is a civil
suspension, and a decision of the commissioner or hearing officer under
this section shall not be appealable.
