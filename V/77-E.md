state. Property owned by the business enterprise shall be valued at its
original cost.
                                             
 (c) The portion of the base from dividends shall be apportioned
on the basis of the 3 following factors, giving equal weight to each,
and applying the average of the 3 percentages to the dividends:
                                             
 (1) The compensation apportionment factor in subparagraph

the United States government, within this state regardless of free on
board point or other conditions of sale, or the property is shipped from
an office, store, warehouse, factory or other place of storage in this
state and (A) the purchaser is the United States government, or (B) the

other than sales of tangible personal property are in this state if the
revenue-producing activity is performed in this state, or the
revenue-producing activity is performed both in and outside this state
and a greater proportion of the revenue-producing activity is performed
in this state than in any other state, based on costs of performance.
                                             
 II. If the method of apportionment in paragraph I does not fairly
represent the business enterprise's business activity in this state, the
business enterprise may petition for, or the commissioner may require,
in respect to all or any part of the business enterprise's business
activity, if reasonable:
                                             
 (a) The exclusion of any one or more of the apportionment
factors;
                                             
 (b) The inclusion of one or more additional apportionment factors
which will fairly represent the business enterprise's business activity
in the state; or
                                             
 (c) The employment of any other method to effect an equitable
apportionment of the business enterprise's enterprise value tax base.

believe that a business enterprise failed to file a return or to include

the business enterprise of any penalty for failure to make a correct
