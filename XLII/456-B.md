 I. A notarial act has the same effect under the law of this state as
if performed by a notarial officer of this state if performed within the
jurisdiction of and under authority of a foreign nation or its
constituent units or a multi-national or international organization by
any of the following persons:

office.
                                             
 III. A certificate by a foreign service or consular officer of the
United States stationed in the nation under the jurisdiction of which
the notarial act was performed, or a certificate by a foreign service or
consular officer of that nation stationed in the United States,
conclusively establishes any matter relating to the authenticity or
validity of the notarial act set forth in the certificate.
                                             
 IV. An official stamp or seal of the person performing the notarial
act is prima facie evidence that the signature is genuine and that the
person holds the indicated title.
                                             
 V. An official stamp or seal of an officer listed in subparagraph

title has authority to perform notarial acts.
                                             
 VI. If the title of office and indication of authority to perform
notarial acts appears either in a digest of foreign law or in a list
customarily used as a source for that information, the authority of an
officer with that title to perform notarial acts is conclusively
established.

dated by a notarial officer. The certificate must include identification
of the jurisdiction in which the notarial act is performed and the title
of the office of the notarial officer and may include the official stamp

If the officer is a commissioned officer on active duty in the military
service of the United States, it must also include the officer's rank.

 (c) Is in a form prescribed by the laws or regulations applicable
in the place in which the notarial act was performed; or
                                             
 (d) Sets forth the actions of the notarial officer and those are
